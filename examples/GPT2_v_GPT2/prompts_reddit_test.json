  "you don't nessecarily need all that stuff. Ive changed 3 sets of tires with some $11 tire irons and like 2 $2 pack of extra Long zip ties.  you should look at sport touring then. \n\nI had the Bridgestone T30 Evo's (think they have new version). They handled well in dry and the rain and they're usually cheaper than other tires in this class. I'm from SoCal tho so not much rain.\n\nRoadsmarts or Angel GT are another good choice, Angel's being pricier.\n\nI have the Road 5 now and they're great. Highly recommend but if you're on a budget they might be a bit on the pricier side",

  "If you're stopping at the fastest the bike can, the rear is skipping in the air. For sportsbikes at least. if you have enough weight on the back tire for the rear brake to be effective, you're not braking as hard as you could be in the front. The weight transfer to the front means the traction there actually increases the harder you brake. By carefully using this traction we can stop faster with only the front vs using both brakes. \n\nThe most important thing is to keep both tires in contact with the ground without transitioning from static friction to dynamic friction.

  "Thank you for this! Lol and thanks for the red hair compliment :p\n\nI\u2019ve definitely got to turn off the news it\u2019s just hard when you want to be an informed voter and citizen and what not but it really does mess with my mind. I hate our politics right now it makes me sick. I think it\u2019s really putting a flashlight on this sleazebag patriarchy as you call it, it\u2019s hard to feel like the majority of men aren\u2019t sleezes when the president and alllllll them other government officials are so blatantly sexist, and they rule the country. \n\nAlso, I have not been as attracted to my BF, that is very correct. He has no muscle definition, and I know it sounds vain, but he really isn\u2019t physically attractive to me anymore bc of it. I started suggesting this best I could trying not to totally crush his spirit, and he said he\u2019s going to start working out. So I guess we will see if it helps.\n\nI feel awful but for a year we\u2019ve almost like friend zoned each other (me doing it to him really), we basically just feel like friends who stress each other out, still manage to have fun, and live together. We are not intimate, largely again on my part, I haven\u2019t been interested. I have no drive, no passion, no desire. I\u2019m usually exhausted which doesn\u2019t help, but it\u2019s been a rough year for us.\n\nI know my BF is sexually frustrated now too. It sucks. I don\u2019t know how to talk about this with him or what to even say :( i like and love the guy a lot, we just don\u2019t act like a couple much anymore. I think there\u2019s many reasons for that.\n\nOne such reason, he makes me feel self conscious in public. If I say something funny or weird, he will give me an unquestionably embarrassed and frustrated look. He shushes me in public if I\u2019m getting goofy or silly and honestly it makes me feel ashamed and so self conscious. I know he has a lot of anxiety himself, but he just puts wayyyy to much stress on us both to keep others happy. I\u2019ve brought this up to him before but I just don\u2019t feel like he\u2019s tried to change? Idk.\n\nOne example - he ran a marathon last weekend. I know, you\u2019d think he\u2019d be in killer shape, but really he\u2019s a twig. I\u2019m tiny at 5\u20192 and 105lbs, well he has the same size arms as I do......anyways. He finishes the marathon and when he comes over to me, sweating and totally out of breath, he says, \u201cI think we are taking up too much space, can you move our bags over\u201d, and I almost lost it like wtf. We had two tiny bags sitting right next to me. He just ran a MARATHON and he was concerned we were in other people\u2019s way, whereas other marathoners are straight sprawled out on the ground dying, rightfully so. I didn\u2019t even know what to do, I just looked at him and I\u2019m like dude we are fine.\n\nI also can\u2019t stand how he lacks assertiveness. It drives me mad. When it comes to sticking up for me, he doesn\u2019t. It takes him extreme effort to defend me if someone has been rude to me or something. And you can tell he\u2019s dying of anxiousness if he does try to stick up for me. I\u2019m not a damsel in distress, I\u2019m quite quick to defend myself when needed, but it\u2019s nice to have someone back you up and generally to feel supported....but here\u2019s an example. \n\nHe and his family of 4 including himself are insanely close. Super tight knit. I hate visiting them bc I feel like a total outsider and they really could care less about my presence, I feel like dead weight, totally friendzoned by him in those cases lol. I start telling a story (basically the first one I told on the visit), and his dad immediately picks up his phone. He\u2019s on it the whole time. I finish my story, and I kid you not, his dad looks up to my BF and asks him a random question that is completely unrelated to what I was just talking about. I was dumbfounded it was so damn rude. His dad says \u201csorry don\u2019t worry I was listening\u201d...no that\u2019s a lie...This was the first time my BF has ever stuck up for me around his family. He said \u201cwell what did you think?\u201d (In regards to my story). That\u2019s it. He was red and nervous just to confront his dad about being an ass to his GF. Like idk maybe it\u2019s just me but I haaaate feeling like I have no support from him in this way. It\u2019s killing me. He\u2019s super supportive in other ways, and I\u2019m obviously extremely sympathetic to mental struggles bc of my own, but sometimes it feels like he hasn\u2019t made progress or isn\u2019t doing a damn thing to improve. Harsh, I know. :( i definitely get what you mean with all of this. You could have described my own boyfriend in some ways, and my own anxieties. These things, like him not being 'strong' enough, or him not sticking up for you, this all happened to me basically.\n\nExamples:\nMy guy is non-confrontive as can be and we've had fights about this a few times. Mostly because our neighbours are trash, serious trailer trash, with three little kids, and they are noisy all the time, from 6 AM to about 7-8 PM. It's impossible for me to sleep later than 5:30/6 when they start making noise and I can't work at home most of the times... He knows this affects me (obviously!) and especially my mental health... but he does not want to speak to the neighbours. (I can't myself, because they speak 0 English and I don't speak their language... I moved country to be with my boyfriend). There haven't really been any other situations where he needed to stick up for me, and I do think he would if I were insulted in front of him (he did when it happened) but with the neighbours, he just wants to keep the peace and all.\n\nThe same with his body... He's very tall and very thin... and all the people I'm attracted to usually have... well, are not really chubby but have a bit of flesh on them, if you get what I mean, and I've started to find him really really unsexy because he's just so gangly.\n\nIn a way, then, we're in a very similar situation, and I can understand you very well! My depression is getting worse because of it, and I'm confused about everything, because I do love my boyfriend, I just don't know if love is enough to stay together. I don't want to leave (yet) either, because well, I do love him. How is it for you? Do you think you might be happier with someone else or on your own? I think about this a lot personally. I don't want to be alone, but the points above, PLUS the fact that my boyfriend and I seem to have very little in common lately (he doesn't care about things I like, like reading, etc. and I don't care about his boring programming job at a boring company at all) makes it really really hard. It's so... difficult to admit it, but sometimes I feel like maybe we just don't mesh any more. We did, for a time, and it was so nice, and I want to hold on to it, but if I met my boyfriend right now, we'd never go further than being maybe-friends. Like you already mentioned, it's a lot like simply being roommates, and we don't often have sex either because there we're incompatible too (I'd love to have a more dominant boyfriend, but at the same time, he wants to have a dominant girlfriend in bed, which I really am not and don't feel comfortable to be).\n\nI'm sorry I made this post so much about me. I'm hoping you find this information valuable, and maybe can draw some conclusions for yourself about your own situation. You know, I don't know you, but I think you're just young, like me, and probably confused. This situation with your boyfriend is not healthy, and I might even call it abusive, but it has a lot of self-abuse in it. You might disagree with that, but maybe there's some kind of truth in it. There's only so many issues you can 'work on' as a couple, but if you don't feel at home with his family and he is openly rude to you (like at the marathon) this suggests a lack of respect from him and his family both. I am lucky because my boyfriend's mom is really nice to me, and his dad too, but what you're going through sounds horrible! These people don't seem to respect you at all, no wonder you're starting to blame yourself! If everyone around me, and especially my partner, were putting me down (the dad is doing this by showing you such disrespect!), I'd start to question myself (my appearance, my way of being/thinking) too! But you shouldn't. THEY are the jackasses, not you.\n\nAs far as the news goes... I understand it's difficult to cut it out, and maybe you don't have to, but you should definitely screen WHAT exactly you read in detail. Of course you want to be informed, and you're probably in the US, so you get a lot of Trump(-sexist)-bullshit, but maybe you can read headlines only and only go in depth when it's really relevant. However, I still think the issues are not the news, but much closer to home, and once you've solved them, you'll be able to read the news and detach from them just fine.\n\nPS: wear ponytails!

  "Do these people only live on dairy? How does every other food product get to their grocery stores? What a ridiculous thing to say.\n\nAnd no, it's not the size. Australia is roughly as spread out as Canada and has a smaller population yet their prices are half the prices Canadians pay. The reason is that our telecommunication companies have a government legislated oligopoly that has been given the freedom to operate as a cartel. australia has a little ring of population around the edge, and not much of anything in the middle. They don\u2019t have forestry or oil for the most part in the interior. Nobody is lighting up the country side with infrastructure. There\u2019s a few areas with service and nothing in between. \n\nMost other grocery staples don\u2019t require the same level of climate control that dairy does.

  "is there anything (blog post, in-depth comment, etc.) you can share on your research? I'd be curious to check it out.  I had a 2/3rds finished blog post on the issue from a long time ago, but never got around to finishing it. I'd send what I have, but it's in a catastrophically messy state, and I don't want you to think I'm a crazy person.\n\nThere were probably three or four main things that I focused on, though, that I'd be happy to say more about (or at least try) if you're interested. \n\nThe first was try to understand the history and interpretation of the actual \"secret\" of Fatima -- the threefold prophecy given to the children. There were a lot of problematic things about this: what exactly the secret was, *when* the secret was recorded and made public (and whether it underwent any revision before it did). Most significantly, there was the issue of how to interpret the prophecy, and whether it was actually fulfilled or not.\n\nThe bulk of the post focused on this and on how elements of the prophecy seem to have not come true. I also looked at this in conjunction with the wider movement of what we might call modern Marian apocalypticism -- other purported Marian apparitions accompanied by some message of imminent eschatological disaster. (I can't remember if I mentioned it anywhere else in this thread, but I looked especially toward Wojcik's concept of \"avertive apocalypticism.\")\n\nI also spent some time on the place and importance of things like this in Catholic theology. There's some question and confusion as to what all is entailed by miracles like these that have been \"official confirmed\" by the Vatican. A lot of people still have the impression that this still doesn't mean much, or that it hasn't *really* been \"officially confirmed.\" \n\nI also spent some time on what we might call the \"history of religion\" background here. I spent some time looking at earlier (and later) parallels to the Miracle of the Sun event itself, which was sort of the grand finale of the wider Fatima phenomenon, so to speak. But I also looked at the broader background of this wider sequence of Marian apparitions and the particular *message* that was emphasized at Fatima (Mary desiring the institution of a specific form of devotion/consecration to her). \n\nI looked at this particularly in conjunction with what might be call the \"sanctuary-founding\" motif -- something widely attested throughout multiple times and cultures, where a god or goddess or other figure appears to a special person, and commands them to construct a temple or other site of worship in their honor. I think this is probably the broadest/earliest recognizable form of the sort of thing that fundamentally underlies the Fatima apparition and Mary's command for devotion. (I can't remember if Mary also specifically commanded that a sanctuary/church be built for her at Fatima, but possibly.)\n\n\n\n[Edit:] A few book references, if anyone's interested. I already mentioned the work of the work of Daniel Wojcik. One of the best academic studies of modern Marian apparitions in general is Zimdars-Swartz\u2019 *Encountering Mary: From La Salette to Medjugorje*. We could add something like Chris Maunder's *Our Lady of the Nations: Apparitions of Mary in Twentieth-century Catholic Europe* to this; and for Fatima in particular, there's also Bennett\u2019s *When the Sun Danced: Myth, Miracles, and Modernity in Early Twentieth-Century Portugal*, etc.",
  "You're right. I misspoke. The later is true. Because it defeats the reason of why you bring up the topic of indoctrination. \n\nSo you lie because it defeats the reason? \n\nYou're using an ad-hominem attack, plain and simple.\n\nIf you feel that indoctrination is an attack, then why don't you consider your indoctrination when you think about your beliefs and how weak your evidence is? \nPointing out that you were indoctrinated is not an attack. It's a fact. The whole idea behind indoctrination is to convince you that your doctrine is right, despite the evidence to the contrary. This is a serious problem for anyone who is trying to evaluate evidence that contradicts your doctrine. I'm pointing out this issue, not attacking you. \n\nI woke up at 5am today. Do you believe it? \n\nI have no reason not to believe it. We know that people do in fact wake up at 5am. And there are no consequences if I get it wrong. \n\nMy grandmother died from cancer, but got up 4 days later. I can show you a picture of her eating dinner. Do you believe me? \n\nIt's a silly saying. All claims require evidence. Without a clear definition of \"extraordinary evidence\" means...\n\nYes, all claims require evidence. Some claims require more and better evidence. Its a guideline suggesting that common occurrences with low risk don't need to be scrutinised as thoroughly as less common and higher risk claims. Why do creationists have so much trouble with this? \n\nThe evidence for Christianity is the historical backing on the NT accounts of Jesus.\n\nThere is no extra biblical historical backing for anything in the bible except for the existence of places and some mundane scenarios. There's no evidence that Jesus actually did anything miraculous. Some scholars aren't even convinced a man named Jesus existed. \n\nTo the best of my knowledge, Hinduism doesn't make too many claims about history.\n\nStay ignorant, that way you can keep saying this. But it's not true. Do you really think the millions of Hindu arent as convinced of their religions as you are of yours? That somehow you're smarter and have better evidence? Haha. Please. This is your special pleading fallacy. \n\nIn order to investigate critical issues, I need to abandon my Christian faith before looking?\n\nWhile it would certainly help, that's not what I said. You're believing things because of faith, not evidence. \n\nI've spent the last 10 years critically looking into issues and holding onto faith in Christ.\n\nThis doesn't sound like any unbiased method of evaluating the evidence for your religion. Sounds to me like you're using faith instead of evidence. \n\nThat's like asking you to abandon your atheism before talking to me about the...\n\nI don't know what you think atheism means, but to me it means I don't have a belief in any gods. There is no doctrine or dogma or rules or funny hats. Atheism to me just means that I'm not convinced at this time that there are any gods. It doesn't make sense to abandon ones disbelief in something before being convinced of it. \n\nHas the order of creation wrong compared to what? Science? Do you think Genesis 1 is intended to be a scientific account?\n\nI believe that millions of Christians believe its an accurate account of the beginning of life on earth, and the universe itself. As such, it absolutely is a scientific question. \n\nYou haven't made your case for anything in the bible except to point back to the bible. Is genesis any accurate account of history? ",
  "i never said you did not have a good argument.   You do.  All I have ever said is that is is an internal circular argument.   Just because you can say something logically does not mean it is true.  Your arguement is true only if you are correct.   There is not enough evidence other than internal reasoning that shows you are correct. \n\nThat is why you can interchange one or two words and make the completely opposite argument. \n\nWhen I changed the words in your OP I was trying to show you this.  My changed version was still an internal circular argument. \n\nYou only come to the conclusion of your premise because you previously accepted that we cannot change our wants.  An individual who accepts that we can change our wants can reach a logical conclusion as well.\n\nIt is fine if you choose to accept you arguement and it is fine if you choose not to.  Just know that both sides are making an internal circular argument due to the fact that they previously accepted the premise of their particular prospective.   That is why you can interchange one or two words and make the completely opposite argument. \n\nI showed you how this is not because it's circular, but because it's logically valid. The conclusion necessarily follows from the premises. Of course if you change the premises and the conclusion it can still be valid - you can come up with any valid argument you want. That's what I demonstrated to you in the photosynthesis example. If an argument is circular it means that the conclusion is directly or indirectly contained in the premises. This would be a circular argument: Grass reflects photons of the wavelength of green light. Grass is a plant. Therefore grass is green. So I have two questions for you: \n\n1) Which of the premises of my argument contains the conclusion?\n\n2) How are my premises incorrect?\n\n",

  "No worries, I find languages fascinating and enjoy talking about them too. I know next to nothing about Arabic, but I've always found it interesting to see written and to listen to. I also learned a bit of German back in school, and I can definitely sympathize with how annoying the grammar can get. Dealing with three genders sucks, but I do kind of like how you can just make new words by stringing nouns and adjectives together. Recently though I've been learning Japanese, which has actually been kind of eye-opening since it's so radically different from English. I'm not looking forward to all the kanji I'm going to have to learn, but it's been interesting trying to get a feel for the \"flow\" of the language. The agglutination is also kinda fun - you can modify any verb like  (wakaru - to understand) with a bunch of suffixes to make expressions like  (wakaritakunakatta - did not want to understand) for example.\n\nPronunciation-wise I think Japanese is actually pretty simple compared to English, aside from the issue of how to read kanji - it only has five vowel sounds (a - \"ah\", e - \"eh\", i - \"ee\", o - \"oh\", u - \"oo\") and extended forms of them, so there aren't really any nasty exceptions like the English \"eau\" to deal with. For example, a word like  (deau - to meet) is pronounced \"deh-ah-oo\", since the vowels mostly only make one sound. The only ambiguity that's coming to mind at the moment is \"ou\", which can either represent the long \"oh\" or the two vowels separately (\"oh-oo\"), but aside from that figuring out how to pronounce a Japanese word is really straightforward imo. \n\nAre you familiar with Langfocus on Youtube? That's probably where most of my casual language knowledge comes from, along with /r/languagelearning. it blows my mind how he could summarize the arabic language (and probably most of the issues that will face new learners) in such a short channel video.

  "my bad am i wanted a more detailed information since naruto has many gerne, so i meant what about the comedy parts also if there are some sort of plot twists that might be \u201escary\u201c for younger persons(you could have been 10 or something) and stuff like that.\n\nBut I would personally say these are some similar animes:\n\n-Fairy Tail \nIts also a long anime(400 eps +) and the last season will start in a few weeks. Its set in a magical world with also a team to be focused on. Its more about magic and monsters, but also given quite a few good human vs human fight. It also offers comedy aspects and work with plot twists, also the main theme playing through fights is a really good one.\n\n-Is it wrong to try to pick up a girl in a dungeon(also called \u201aDanmachi\u2018) 13 ep\nIs set arround a adventure, his job is to go to the dungeon and kill monsters to earn money. The world is in some way like a game, leveling your abilities, getting level ups etc. The story also follows a young boy who gets stronger and more mature through out the story.\n\n-Nanatsu no taizai (The seven deadly sins) 36 ep\nThis is more of a personal recommendation, its not really close to naruto, but a show i would definitely recommend watching, I think i do not need to tell you what it is about since it is almost completely explained in the first episode, however the more fun part (at least for me) were the last 12 ep (and hopefully the episodes that will come in the future) because that is where the story and fights get extremely fun to watch.\n\nOther animes you could give a try:\n-HunterXHunter\n-My hero academica\n-One piece\n\nOverall there is a shit tons of anime every season (for 3 months) many anime air and that are by far more you will be able to watch, but that way there is almost always a new anime you will enjoy. I would recommend watching animes like you do and if you are more confident to find a show you like you could give it a try with a seasonal anime, because it is great browsing on reddit through the newest episode and read what people think about it and what they expect coming up next.

Two scoops would be a Whooper and 3 scoops, thanksgiving's turkey serving. \n\nAlso, protein is not a substance that goes to your blood, there is no 'too much to be absorbed at once'; it's a food product, a byproduct of milk, just like cheese, yogurt or powdered milk. You have too much it and the following things happen: 1) you use what you need 2) you get fat 3) you start to pee the broken up unused aminoacids and finally 4) w/e protein that has gone through the system and has not met the former fates, ends up unused in your poop, just like all food.

NJPW has alot of botches but it still added to the drama because of how the athletes bounced back and added it to the drama. But when Shawn and Taker did it, they removed a quarter of a star.

That means learning the exposure triangle - the three simple variables that control exposure. YouTube has many videos on it. Learn that, and you'll be able to shoot anything.

  "i guess I mean in general but I am talking about the helicopter trip here. I can definitely see shooting bursts frequently but not consistently for an entire hour. If I am just trying to ensure that my photos aren't blurry, I'm going to up my shutter speed. Otherwise, you're going to get 10 blurry shots a second. Most helicopter flights are during good light (3 hours before sunlight is basically mid-afternoon sun). If you can't get 1/1000 in mid-day sun, I doubt bursting will help. Most online articles about helicopter photography tours say 1/1000 is plenty.\n\nReference1:\n\"With the speed of the helicopter, the amount of turbulence, and a 200mm focal length, I ended up needing 1/1,000 s, 3,200 ISO, and f/4.\"\n\nReference2:\nThis is just a general rule and you will need to judge the conditions of the flight yourself--but as a good starting point a 1/500secs shutter speed (for a 24-70mm lens) will give you good results.\n\nReference3:\nI read recommendations online for a shutter speed anywhere between 1/250th and 1/1000th of a second. The recommendations for 1/250th seemed to be coming from people who hired an airplane or helicopter specifically for photo shooting where they could tell the pilot to slow down.\n\nReference4:\nPrior to the flight, I was recommended minimum shutter speeds ranging from 1/500 through 1/1000. I made 1/500 work at times, but at other times, 1/1000 was not fast enough. Longer focal lengths need faster shutter speeds - as you would expect.\n\nReference5:\nYour shutter speed doesn\u2019t really need to be mega fast. Depending on the lens you are using, 1/250 for wide lenses and 1/1250s and higher for telephoto lenses could do.  Why, it's very easy to get 1/1000 of a second shutter speed 3 hour before sunset. Do you think that bursting is going to help with vibration or composition? Every online resource I found said 1/1000 is sufficient to overcome the helicopter shaking.  ",
  " It is, just not per unit area. And since that total brightness leads to lower noise this is useful information.\n\nNo it doesn't,  I can give you several examples of crop sensor cameras that out perform a FF camera, due to just being more efficient sensor designs.  The knowlage of total light hitting the sensor in no way tells you at what point to expect noise in your image.  \n\nNo, but the equivalent focal length does.\n\nThey have an equivalent fov, not focal length.  \n\nNo, I think you'll find the vast majority of the time they care most and are asking about the depth of field. \n\nWhen they are asking about the amount of light for low light shooting, there is no fucking way they are asking about depth of field.  \n\nAlso does light gathering from the same aperture suffer degradation by the crop factor?\n\nThat is the question the OP asked, how the hell is that about depth of field or noise on the sensor, it is about EXPOSURE.  That is what they were asking.  \n\nSee my earlier comment about a camera system where you never know what the exposure actually is. It would be completely usable and completely logical.\n\nYes, in a magical world where people don't shoot film and photography isn't taught off the exposure triangle, and people don't ever shoot manual, and always have a light meter, your way works.  I don't live in that land, so it doesn't help out anyone in this one...  No it doesn't, I can give you several examples of crop sensor cameras that out perform a FF camera\n\nIt does. The fact you can cherry pick examples using cameras from 2002 doesn't mean you can't derive useful information about the expected performance with today's cameras, which have for a while now been pretty much on par when it comes to SNR (noise) from midtones to hightlights. Here you go - three cameras with three different sensor manufacturers, with more or less exactly the same noise (except that Sony is doing NR above 6400):\n\nhttps://imgur.com/C1QT8W5\n\n due to just being more efficient sensor designs. The knowlage of total light hitting the sensor in no way tells you at what point to expect noise in your image.\n\nIf you study actual data rather than making things up of the op your head then you would know that \"more efficient sensor designs\" in terms of SNR stopped appearing a while ago, the only real differences now are in read noise and DR, neither of which are affected by light levels. If you know the level photon noise inherent in the image projected by the lens (which is what total light tells you), you can draw firm conclusions about behaviour on different sensor sizes provided the sensors are not ancient.\n\nCase in point, OP was asking about crop mode on the same sensor! Therefore performance is identical and you can tell precisely what the noise will be by considering total light gathering.\n\nnbsp;\n\n\n That is the question the OP asked, how the hell is that about depth of field or noise on the sensor, it is about EXPOSURE. That is what they were asking.\n\nThis particular person was not asking about depth of field but the majority of questions about crop factor are.\n\nNo they are not asking about EXPOSURE. The word doesn't appear anywhere in the question, regardless of casing. The question was \"does light gathering from the same aperture suffer degradation by the crop factor?\" and the answer is that yes you gather less light, regardless of what the exposure is. How is that so difficult for you to understand?\n\n Yes, in a magical world where people don't shoot film and photography isn't taught off the exposure triangle, and people don't ever shoot manual, and always have a light meter\n\nYou don't need to know what the exposure actually is in numerical terms to do any of that. If you designed a crop camera system and marked all of the lenses with 1.5x their focal length, and 1.5x the aperture, adjusted the ISO settings, then *all* of the principals you mention above, the exposure triangle, manual shooting, using a light meter would apply exactly the same. Only the exposure would be different - but you would never know (or likely, care). ",

  " The odds are calculated to give the bookies the best shot at making money regardless of which way people bet\n\nI'd offer a slight correction - for events like football games, the odds are calculated to try to get people to bet such that the bookies get the same amount of money regardless of the outcome of the event.\n\nIn an ideal situation, all the money that the losers lose is exactly the same amount as the winners win (edit: *regardless of who wins the football game*), and the house walks away with whatever percentage they take from every bet. There's no risk.\n\nnbsp;\n\nThe odds for parimutuel betting (e.g. horse races) are calculated based on how much money goes on each horse. The odds you see are just estimates - the actual payouts depend on all of the bets once the betting is closed. \n\nIn simple terms, all of the losers' money is divided among all of the winners. \n\nSo if you picked a horse that most people didn't, and it wins, then you have a lot of losers and only a few winners and you get a big payout. Similarly, if you picked a horse that most people also picked, and it wins, then you have a lot of winners splitting the money of a few losers.\n  then the team or individual associated with those ratio would have a lower chance of winning\n\nIt might look that way, but in fact, that's not how it works.\n\nIf you roll a fair die, there is a 1/6 probability (a 1 in 6 chance) you'll get a 6, which corresponds to odds of 1-5. This probability is calculated by dividing the number of favourable outcomes (getting a 6) by the number of possible outcomes (getting a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6), assuming all outcomes are equally likely.\n\nWith odds, on the other hand, there's no way of calculating them exactly, like we can with a die, so they are estimated. One bookmaker might offer you odds of 1-4 because they think it's about 4 times more likely the team, horse, etc will lose than win, but another might believe the team is more likely to win and offer you odds of 2-1. (In practice, the odds are unlikely to vary by as much as that, because they are based on \"form\" - the past performance of whatever is being bet on.)\n\nSo the odds don't really tell you anything about the likelihood of anyone winning. All they tell you is what return you'll get on your bet if the team do win.",
  "it's not for rate, but to ensure that the potential of the helicopter and line stay as close to the same as possible for the duration of embarking/disembarking.\n\nThe problem is that power lines usually carry AC power. In AC, the potential constantly changes - at 1 moment the line potential might be +150,000 volts, and then 1/120 second later, it might be - 150,000 volts. If the helicopter just makes a brief contact to equalise the charge - because of the alternating nature of the line potential, the potential difference will be back a fraction of a second later.\n\nIn order to deal with this, a constant low-resistance connection is needed between the helicopter and the line (for example with a clamp), so that they are constantly held at the same potential, while there is any risk that a linesman might simultaneously touch the helicopter and the line. \n\nThis alternating nature of AC voltage and the capacitance (ability to store charge) of the helicopter, gives the weird situation of a current being able to flow, even if there is not a complete circuit - this has to be taken into account, and a clamp or stick used to carry the current, to protect the linesman.\n thank you.",

That is also an asshole thing to do, you know? Some people don't see it the way you do. They see it like: Imagine you are with someone you love and years later tells you a pretty unusual fetish about having sex with others. Some are ok with it, but don't be *shocked if others are not* and label them as assholes for being annoyed at that. You see things in very black and white and general terms.\n\nSome people might not care and see it as just a sexual interest and nothing more (much like you). Except you also have to understand that other people might not see this the way you do. Other *might* care about that... maybe just a little bit...lol. \n\nThe fetish by itself is not wrong (at least I believe that, some don't), but that also doesn't mean the other person is wrong for wanting to reject somebody over it (because they don't like the fetish) and is therefore a little pissed that it's more difficult for them to just walk away when they only know about it after the fact (marriage, pregnancy etc).\n\nIf you deem that to be an unreasonable position, fine. But don't suggest I'm an asshole. I deem it unreasonable that you deny them the choice in the first place, because this isn't something that most people would equate to an ordinary sexual preference (much like you) that is harmless in not disclosing after putting someone into a commitment (marriage, pregnancy) without their knowledge of details that would be considered by the majority of people in this case to be relevant, because it also involves them, not just the person with the fetish, and it would have been nice to know earlier, at least, to some people (not you in this case it seems). Hence why most agree with me (and not you). Perhaps you don't and you equate it to nothing more than just a sexual interest and see this in a very black and white manner, even though it could lead to other implications that are more damaging (divorce etc that could have been avoided, as I'm sure you thought of this topic deeply before posting your comment), and that's fine. You may believe it fine, and I respect that, but please, don't misjudge people as assholes for it. Some people don't want it. Also, it's funny how you call me childish and entitled... when you are the one who views this topic in a one dimensional and simplistic way.",

  "i understand, but one of the cornerstone of programming is \"DRY\" (Do Not Repeat Yourself).\n\nWriting `const char *` instead of `LPCSTR` is not repeating yourself. If you want to avoid repeating yourself, you are looking for type inference, not type aliases.\n\nFor instance, the Windows API does lots of this and uses lots of typedef aliases for simplifying and making easier to read the code. For instance, LPVOID is void*, LPCSTR is const char* when unicode is not defined, LPCWSTR is cosnt wchar_t* (Unicode 16 bits) and so on.\n\nThese are awful. They really are. The Window API is notorious for being one of the most awful APIs to read code from, ever. That's not just the type aliases of course, there are lots of other issues like the many functions that have half a dozen mandatory NULL parameters, but it's part of it.\n\nThe code should not be cryptic or hard to read as human time is expensive and lots of studies have shown that developers spend a lot of their time reading code.\n\n`const char *` is not difficult to read. It simply isn't. It's extremely common in C code. If that's something you have difficulty reading, you are a new and very inexperienced C programmer. \n\nBy using type aliases you can replace the type if it is no longer suitable, the OpenGL C-API also does it as the type GLFloat which is an alias to float can be changed depending on the compiler settings, architecture or future need. \n\nNo you can't. Doing so would break ABI compatibility, which is unacceptable. The OpenGL `GLfloat` type is not going to change. It will always be a 32-bit single-precision floating-point number. Changing it would break *hundreds of millions of lines of code*.\n\nThe Windows API has a `WORD` typedef. The idea was that it would change to whatever the natural word size of the processor is. So on 16-bit platforms it was a 16-bit integer, but would be a 32-bit integer on a 32-bit version of the API and a 64-bit integer on the 64-bit API. Needless to say, it's still 16-bit and always will be.  const char \\*\n\nSurely that it is easy to read, but you can generalize what I have said to other complicated cases. Specially function pointers and other crazy pointers constructs. My point is that anything that is hard to read should be simplified by using some type alias or abstraction.\n\n",
  " Is that sane?\n\nIn general, not much in XML is no it isn't sane in and by itself. It's an artifact of XML being specified as a strict SGML subset, and the deliberate choice of the XML designers to not support SGML end-tag minimization. In SGML, you can just use\n\n    numberOfAxes6/\n\nor even just\n\n    numberOfAxes6\n\n(with the proper declaration allowing end-tag omission for `numberOfAxes` in place) to express the same logical document. Or you could use SGML short references and other more exotic minimization features to change the appearance of the `numberOf` element more drastically.\n\nAlso, SGML has *concurrent markup* (not widely used, though). Concurrent markup allows things such as\n\n    (DTD1)pAnd the Lord said,\n    (DTD2)qRead my lips: Do not murder./(DTD1)p\n    (DTD1)pBe nice to each other instead./(DTD2)q\n    And the people said \"Amen.\"/(DTD1)p\n\n(*taken from http://xml.coverpages.org/DeRoseEML2004.pdf*) where text can be tagged in an overlapping fashion such as would be useful for marking up poetry, speech, and eg. postal addressing data.",

That's a contract. Business don't simply interact without consent from each other \n\n*Edit* - figured I'd add this for you. This is the restaurant affiliate sign up form so they can reach out to you, verify you're the owner, make sure you understand you're requirements, offer you the order manager if you want it, and also setup the account they will bill you from for refunds. Just so you can see it's not them just sending people to the restaurant without their consent. Their is a contract between the businesses.\n\nhttps://www.doordash.com/merchant/apply/",

  "like I said, If MY was playing aggressive and making plays and causing TSM to win games due to his play, why wouldn't TSM start MY?\n\n Clearly this was NOT the best way for TSM to win. They got 3-0'd ffs. They failed to adapt to the meta, as it is not as set in stone as you pretend it to be. Arguing that Grig = Blaber as far as aggressive play is concerned is just straight up wrong.\n\nYou think Grig not being Nocturne was the reason TSM was losing to C9? Have you ever maybe thought that TSM just not be as good of a team as C9? Wins and losses isn't black and white as you are making it out to be. If that was the case Echo Fox would have beaten TSM because Dardoch was going full on aggressive.  if you had actually watched TSM when they started MY, you'd know they quickly switched his champion selections over to tankier champions that he had less experience on because they lost a few games failing to adapt to playing with a carry-style jungler. He had performed well with Lee Sin and Nidalee -- two champions that quickly fell out of the meta. They forced him on tanks for a while, and his performance suffered significantly because he wasn't as comfortable on those champions or that playstyle. They then switched to Grig because he was more comfortable playing the passive jungle style required for tankier jungler picks. It's a team problem -- not just the jungler. They fail to play well with carry junglers in any sense.  That's not something that can legitimately be argued against at this point.  And their lack of flexibility hurts their performance.\n\nI don't think Grig not being Nocturne was the reason TSM lost. Grig probably doesn't even play that good of a Nocturne considered he's been forced onto tanks his entire professional career.  I think TSM had a very poor grasp on the meta, Bjergsen played far too passively for someone given so much resources, and the jungle / top lane matchups were heavily slanted in C9's favor. TSM forcing their junglers on predictable tanks played a part in this.",

  "starting isn't a deal breaker for a prospect, plenty of raw talents don't start. But at this point, given his play at this age, I think anyone who drafts him as a lottery pick will be disappointed. Unless he suddenly starts drilling threes next season. Or unless the Spurs manage to get a lottery pick and draft him. just mediocre stats though in terms of rebounding steals etc ",
  "The Spurs still made the playoffs without Kawhi and their defensive rating barely dropped at all despite his absence. Harden still chokes in the playoffs and has never taken his teams anywhere so not much to argue there. Point is that the Warriors would not have these past 3 rings without Curry. None of the guys you mentioned have even led their teams to a finals appearance as the first option. Curry has proven himself beyond doubt at this point. He's #9 all time in playoffs ppg. Where's Harden? Kawhi doesn't even average 17 points for his career. Kd needed Curry and joined his team because he knew he couldn't win without him. Give credit where it's due and stop overrating the potential of other players who haven't accomplished half as much as Curry has. Who are the 7? I can only think of Bron, Curry, KD, Harden, Davis, and Kawhi",

  "on the other hand, Davis is one of the best players in the game at attacking the rim and playing in the pick and roll, which values a secondary big who can shoot and space the floor like Mirotic.\n\nThe point here is Davis has so many positive qualities as a big, because he is the best big in the game, that he is every other big's ideal partner. Saying Davis is the best fit for Randle doesn't mean much because anyone you trot out you could say the same thing about em.  Everything you said is true, AD is the perfect fit next to virtually anyone. However, I'm not really sure Randle is a great fit next to AD. Personally I think Mirotic is a better fit alongside AD than Randle is. Randle absolutely can not shoot at all from the outside, and that means that to be effective offensively he needs the ball down low. Now while AD absolutely *can* float to the outside and hit shots from out there, it's not really best utilizing his strengths to relegate him to the wing. IMO that's what Brook Lopez was asked to do last year on the Lakers, and I think it's why his production suddenly nosedived from where it has been in Brooklyn. \n\nI'm assuming the Pelicans won't ask AD to do the same thing, and if Randle is out there with another guy on the team who's playing down low, then I'm not sure where that'll leave Randle. IMO the Pels are better off starting Mirotic alongside AD and bringing Randle in as a small ball center and try to have him play as many minutes as possible alongside Mirotic, rather than AD. ",

  "Oh yeah, I must have forgot about the wave of Cuban militarism that shook the world lol. Savage warmongering beasts, those Cubans.  Common. You literally asked how many countries Cuba had attacked, insinuating there aren't any. Don't get angry just because the data doesn't back up your claim. In fact data unequivocally shows that countries which embrace markets do better economically. Meritocratic systems like that obviously create losers, and that's why redistribution through progressive taxation and regulation against rent seeking behavior is important. A person with $1 in her pocket values $1 more dollar massively more than someone that has $1000 in their pocket. That's just a matter of fact. It makes sense to tax the rich more. That doesn't mean you have to go bananas, and try to make a system where all income and ownership is abolished. You can have a system where you make money the most efficient way (markets), and still have a functioning welfare system. The problem with communism is that it's incentive structure is out-of-wack. People aren't rewarded for working, and the producers don't know what to make. Markets fix this, and introduces more manageable problems, like inequality. But at least those are manageable.",

Not the majors.  i think communication is even more important to players these days. I honestly think that is why managers like Melvin seem to get the most out of their rosters.  No player likes to platoon or not play everyday but if you communicate with them you have a better chance of them buying into what the team is doing. ",
  "I don't think it happens, but financially the Angels could make it happen. They have about $125M committed next year, with a few guys entering their final year of arbitration.  \n\nThat said, they're also paying Pujols until 2022, they probably want to keep Trout, they've got some question marks in their rotation and bullpen and it is also Machado's decision. He may want to sign with a team that is more likely to make the playoffs. In that case Philadelphia is his probable destination. Unless the Nationals can get a ton of pitching this off season (it's a good market for pitching from what I looked at), the Phillies are really only competing with the Braves for the division.  \n\nIt'll be a long off season, though. His agent will wait until the Angels, Phillies and whoever else is in on him make moves to strengthen their 2019 club before making the decision. I kinda want the Phils to wait for Arenado and Trout.",

  "it's a step on the road to \"real communism\" which they refer to as state capitalism, where the country becomes a single all powerful corporation. The create the thing they supposedly fear the most, and then never progress beyond that because nobody knows what step 2 is. No, you introduced a claim I hadn't heard of before and I gave you a fair chance to tell your side of it, though I see now that assuming good faith on your end was naive of me.\n\nIn short, we already know what capitalism leads to and we already know what socialism leads to. The former almost always  leads to flawed nations that leave some by the wayside and others with too much, but pretty good overall compared to anywhere else. The latter never fails to lead to a dictator who censors, oppresses, and ultimately slaughters millions of people for thought-crime.\n\nNeither are perfect but if I had to choose one, I know I'd rather live in the relative utopia of the places that tend to allow nice things like free-speech, religious freedom, generous welfare states and gay marriage, while the former socialist states only barely start to crawl of the brutal trenches they dug themselves into, where basic human rights like the right to criticize the government, are still pretty much non-existent."
