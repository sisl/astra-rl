  "thanks for replying!! These sound like they would work in theory but the thing with couples (at least in my experience) is that some of these things don't end up being practical. Like living together just turns into a natural progression, and then you see more and more of each other, and then eventually you start sharing the same hobbies and interests and friends and so on so forth. I wish it was simpler, but it's hard to keep a life separate from your relationship sometimes  it's important to miss each other sometimes, but also living together is natural after a certain point in a relationship I think! But missing someone makes you feel very differently then when you see them everyday. Wish there was a happy medium :/",

  "what a champion of virtue you've made of him in your fantasy. So according to your theory, he's disgusted enough by the pedophilia to not join in again, but too scared of being killed to speak up about it. \n\nWhy would Epstein include him if he thought he wouldn't agree with it? If Epstein can assassinate him so easily, why would he let him wander around with that information after not coming back a second time, implying he was not a pedophile? Wouldn't that make him a liability? \n\nThat's some pretty dark humor to joke about pedophilia you've witnessed, and refused to report because you thought you might be killed, how heroic. If you go to a pedophile party island even once, and you don't immediately report it, you're culpable, whether you're a pedo or not. \n\nAt least your theory matches with the whole cowardice angle, maybe his bone spurs kept him from reporting to the police just like they kept him out of vietnam.  refused to report\n\nlmao, report to who?",

  "by \"on the verge\" I mostly meant we don't really have any way of stopping him, if Aurene's visions are credible. So yes, we don't exactly have a timer ticking. \n\nBut regarding Kralk's \"endgame\", as far as we can tell it's not sapient like Mordremoth. Its endgame is to eat all the magic and then sleep off the food coma for a few thousand years. And right now it has literally all the magic in the universe on its plate. \n\nAs far as the inactivity, Balthazar *did* nearly kill it back at the end of PoF. sentience, control, and perhaps something a little extra all seem to be requirements for being an Elder Dragon at this point. If all we needed were a large magic container, the human gods easily could have intervened by creating a 'Dragonstone' variant of a new bloodstone designed to strip away and contain dragon magic, since they were the ones that created the initial bloodstone, this was well within their power... Instead, they fled, knowing that dragon magic was either too dangerous to try harnessing or knowing that they couldn't take it away from living dragons without consequence.\n\nBalthazar decided to go against this and tried to destroy the dragons to regain his strength, knowing full-well the consequences of his actions. The kicker being that we never saw him absorb more than a tiny amount of their magic, so we don't actually know whether he truly could have handled it all. \n\nIt's my belief that in order to properly contain dragon magic, the container needs to be both of Tyria, and of the dragons themselves. This can be seen in both the Inquest experiments and the Sons of Svanir. In both cases, the only time we see dragon magic actively being wielded in its raw form outside of the dragons themselves is by becoming corrupted to more closely mirror the nature of the dragon itself. Since Balthazar was drawing magic from Primordus and Jormag, which were canonically labeled as opposing forces, it's possible that this allowed him to avoid that same corruption, or maybe his proximity to Primordus allowed him to maintain his alread firey form through proximity.\n\nIn either case, all we can do is speculate for now.",

  " Al-Ghazali only criticized metaphysical parts of the Greek philosophy\n\nSort of true, but that's kind of the primary point I was talking about as related to the conceptions of God, as those parts are all metaphysical. This doesn't actually counter my point in any way regarding the \"omnibenevolence\" of Allah.\n\nin his book Munqidh min al-d\u0323ala\u0304l he wrote about two problems at the time, people who read Thier knowledge about mathematics and by their astonishment about their precision and knowledge take other beliefs blindly and that others find some unilsamic beliefs and by so reject all their knowledge.\n\nThis is exactly the *problem*. Al-Ghazali defined \"knowledge\" in terms of Islamic belief. This lead to a widespread *rejection* of \"foreign\" (non-Islamic) knowledge, which is why scientific advancement in the Muslim world rapidly stagnated. You are confirming exactly what I argued.\n\nThe rise of science in the Islamic world had it's religious influence, they needed algebra for complicated rules of inheritance we had\n\nI never said otherwise. But once the religious questions were answered, the advancement stagnated. Historically, and due in part due to rejection of foreign advancements.\n\nEvery one of your \"advancements\" in mathematics, which represent a tiny portion of overall mathematical advancements in the rest of the world, are related to a single religious question. My argument was that Al-Ghazali essentially argued that Islam contained all knowledge, therefore mathematics outside that area was useless. From The Savior from Straying:\n\nWhen someone starts to learn it, step by step, he will be interested in philosophies, and he will think that all other matters will be as clear as the math, so, when he sees the unhallowed speaking of the philosophers from the others, unintentionally, he will start to obey the unhallowed behavior of the philosophers, and will say: if the religion was right, so these great scholars would follow it, and when he hears that they (philosophers) deny the religion, he will say that the right path is to reject the religion\u2026\n\nTo prevent ones from this big risk, we should prevent student from studying the mathematics. Although this knowledge (math) is not related to the religion directly, but because it is the starting point to getting stray, it (math) is forbidden.\n\nHere are some Islamic sources discussing the same thing. There is an argument that Al Ghazali was not the sole source of this issue, but even in that article they link him to the change *and* concede it is the common academic position on Islam, and I am basing this claim on, well, the common academic position, not fringe theories which may or may not be correct.\n\nI never argued that all Islamic science stopped, nor did I argue that Al Ghazali influenced every single Muslim scientist ever. But an objective look at history makes it *extraordinarily* clear that there was a major sea change in the Muslim world in the 11th century, and it was linked to Islamic philosophy, which was dominated by the works of Al Ghazali.\n\nWe have a hadeeth that every disease have a cure, hadeeth that camel urine worked as a cure etc. This leads to a critical study of medicine of pure hope without disgust.\n\nI never argued otherwise? Also, camel urine is unhealthy, so, um, the hadeeth are wrong.\n\nAn example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory\n\nUm, where was the influence of Islamic thought in that? I missed it. i never argued otherwise? Also, camel urine is unhealthy, so, um, the hadeeth are wrong.\n\nThere are many unhealthy things that could be used in medication and the hadeeth never claimed that it's healthy infact in a variant of the hadeeth it says that if they want they can drink, ibn sina did prescribe it for certain diseases, regardless of that it's your right to believe/disbelieve in the story.\n\nUm, where was the influence of Islamic thought in that? I missed it.\n\nMuslims not taking such things seriously is what lead to the development of our modern day chemistry by the hands of people like Alrazi.\n\nI'm not countering your main points, just shared some views in some sub-points.\n\nI'm pretty sure that what you quoted doesn't exist in the actual text and since he addressed the other problem of completely rejecting the Greek knowledge due to a problem that contradicts Islamic theology.\n\nActual text: \n\n\u0648\u0642\u062f \u062a\u0648\u0644\u062f\u062a \u0645\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0622\u0641\u062a\u0627\u0646:

believed that Islam is built on ignorance and rejection of definitive evidence and by so he hated the religion more and loved the philosophy more and it greatened on the religion of a felony guessing that Islam will be made victorious by rejecting this knowledge and there is no contradiction between the Sharia nor the theology, the prophet pbuh said that the sun and moon does not eclipse because of the death or birth of anyone, but both are from among the signs of Allah Ta'aala.

  " I don't concede to that.\n\nYou don't believe he performs miracles? Okay, sorry, I don't know what god you're talking about, then. Are you a deist?\n\n but comparing miracles to essentially cheat codes.\n\nPerhaps you could try another analogy. Why shouldn't God use cheat codes, if it would save more people?\n\n The analogy was pointing out that a God that \"used the console commands\" which represent solving a problem via miraculous intervention is not as \"good\" of a being (Anselm version) as one which didn't need to intervene via miracle to accomplish his goals and instead set up the physical laws to accomplish them that way.\n\nOkay, I didn't get that.\n\nSo God would be better if he just set up the physical laws so that everything works out perfectly and everyone freely chooses to believe, without miracles? Okay, I can accept that. Seems a bit contrived to deny him miracles, but if that makes you happy, I've got no problem with it.\n\n How is it \"reading too much into\" it when I showed that your example doesn't actually support that an infinite number of possible worlds exists?\n\nIt does. Are you saying there are finite real numbers? Leave aside the questions about God and omnibenevolence and all that, just consider this: if there is one universe for each real number, how many universes will there be?\n\nThe answer is infinite. So there are infinite possible worlds. Now, of course, that doesn't in and of itself advance God's plan, but it shows that your restriction on the number of possible worlds is arbitrary and not one God is required to obey.\n\n Two things wrong with this. 1) I've never said that God has to abide by physical laws but that he would almost certainly choose to do so in the vast majority of cases. 2) That's been my position from the beginning.\n\nYou told me there were finite possible worlds, I showed there were multiple, and then you changed your argument to 'there are finite possible worlds *that wouldn't require God to do something I don't think he would.*'\n\n I'm not interested in somone's interpretation of a miracle. I'm quite convinced that millions (maybe billions) of people in the past witnessed solar eclipses and believed they were miracles. Just because someone interprets something to be supernatural in origin, doesn't lend any credence that it is truly supernatural in nature.\n\nAgain, are you a deist? Your flair says Christian; do you believe all the miracles attributed to God in the Bible were just natural occurences?\n\nI'm not saying the people in my church believe they witnessed a miracle; they're extremely dubious of any claims of supernatural activity in the modern world. But they all believe that God did regularly perform miracles in the past--sustaining the Israelites with manna, for example, or raising the dead--and will continue to perform miracles in the future.\n\n I.e., if star \"XYZ123456\" in galaxy \"ABC987654\" a billion light years away, never existed it probably won't affect event on this planet.\n\nYeah, he probably wouldn't need to look that far, since I've already shown ways that he can save everyone without needing to.\n\nThis whole argument is me trying to figure out what restrictions you're putting on God and show you how he can still save everyone.\n\nSo far, the main restriction you've set out is:\n\n1). Don't break physical laws too often (but he can set up the laws however he wants, including making them grant prayers by arranging things ahead of time so it happens to work out that way)\n\nAre there any others you'd like to add, so I can be sure we're on the same page?  This whole argument is me trying to figure out what restrictions you're putting on God and show you how he can still save everyone.\n\n I don't know what god you're talking about, then. Are you a deist?\n\nAs I've mentioned in earlier comments, I tend to lean towards deism though not enough to label myself a deist. Ultimately, my view is that if God needs to \"cheat\" by supernaturally intervening with miracles, then he's not as intelligent as a creator that could set up the universe so that what we view as miracles, are nothing more than natural occurances that are perfectly timed and likely, very unlikely. \n\n Seems a bit contrived to deny him miracles, but if that makes you happy, I've got no problem with it. \n\nMaybe it is, but as I explained immediately above, I question the competence of a God who creates a universe which is bound by physical laws but then needs to break them in order to accomplish his goals. I'll concede that sometimes miracles might happen. I'm fairly charitable to the possibility that miracles performed by Jesus would have been at least \"more\" miraculous. Also, maybe its possible that since God has a finite number of possible worlds to work with, that he can't have all the times he wishes to \"show up\" in some way like we see in the bible be strictly the result of cleverly timed physical processes. \n\nBut ultimately, to sum all that up, its a question of which \"type\" of God is *more* omniscient? A God who needs to resort to supernatural interventions or one who can fine tune the physical nature of reality itself so that the clockwork inevitably leads towards his desired outcomes?\n\n just consider this: if there is one universe for each real number, how many universes will there be?\n\nReal numbers are (ironically) not real objects that are found in universes, worlds, etc. (e.g. there are more real numbers than there are particles in this universe, so this universe cannot contain a googolplex) Let me just try and settle it this way: \n\nIt is \"theoretically possible\" that an actual infinity of possible worlds exists. However, this would have no actual impact on this debate. Because the only way in which you can have an actual infinite number of possible worlds is to increase the number of particles in the universe from a finite number (which we see in our observable universe) to an infinite number of particles. It is possible that the universe is infinite in size and thus this would be the case. However, because of previous discussions on how events happening thousands of light years away and further likely have no impact on how events in history play out, then we are left with a finite number of possible worlds in which things can be \"retooled\" for us. \n\nI'll grant that I'm having to stretch my brain here so maybe I'm overlooking something but as long as our observable universe is finite, then there is a finite number of particles to rearrange to make various possible worlds. I'm definitely pulling this math out of my ass, but I would think that the number couldn't be higher than `10^10^105.65` (`10^73` is the estimated number of particles in the observable universe, so I used `10^73!`.). Now the real difficulty is determining how this looks when you change the laws of physics. Is there an infinite number of ways the laws of physics can be changed? What about the speed of light? Is there a universe in which its possible for that to be infinite where observable universes are not relevant? I don't know, but from what I do know about current cosmology, the number of universes found in the universal landscape is finite, which means that the number of possible worlds is finite. \n\n This whole argument is me trying to figure out what restrictions you're putting on God and show you how he can still save everyone.\n\nI'm not setting out to put \"restrictions\" on God. But I do think that he's restricted to being logically coherent. For example, an omnipotent being cannot create a boulder too large for it to lift. Or, an omniscient being would choose to create a universe that needed as minimal violation of the physical laws since those physical laws are placed there by said being and cannot be considered a limitation for him (i.e. if the physical laws were getting in his way, he'd simply used different physical laws).\n\n\nEDIT: Just a little addition to the point about infinite possible worlds. I personally don't think that other universe \"actually\" exist. Or if they do, it seems more likely to be in the flavor of variations on physical laws and not all the various ways our universe *could* have been (e.g. Many Worlds Quantum Mechanics). So unless you can convince me that an actual infinity of possible combinations of this universe exists, then I'm not going to be convinced. Finite particles == finite combinations.",
  "I'm aware of that. There's one for every hold in Skyrim. Probably have some kind of presence in High Rock and again the majority are on the southern border of Cyrodiil...probably a small amount in the rest of Cyrodiil too. Point is the Emperor is hell bent on not getting caught by surprise again. Not to say backwoods Skyrim (and it is backwoods as hell outside of Solitude, Whiterun and maybe Markarth but only because of the silver mines there) isn't important just saying compared to a potential AD invasion it's not all that important (subject to change if Ulfric wins though). They wouldn't commit much if anything at all from the border. Maybe a small amount of legionnaires not based on the border (Cicero's journal does hint at quite a bit of chaos post Great War so that may have happened honestly) but hardly enough to turn the tide beyond the stalemate the Civil War is at the beginning of the game. What you're saying is all speculation. The emperor is hell bent on protecting the empire to the south but personally visits skyrim after his cousin is assassinated? Tulius has lots of imperials in his legions, and specifically  mentions bringing in reinforcements and supplies through. Also, a legate is the commander of a legion and there are several legates in Skyrim. The camps you see in game would be representative of entire legions in the lore.",

The only reason CA has any handguns for sale is that that guns that were on the roster before each of these restrictions were put in place are grandfathered in.\n\nBUT Only so long as absolutely nothing changes on the gun. They use a different cerakote, different grip panels, use a slightly different shaped internal part, or it's using a new formula or material it's considered a new gun and has to be re-tested and have the new requirements.\n\nthe manufacturers have to pay a fee (extortion) every year to keep the gun on the roster PER MODEL.\n\nSO as guns get revamped, updated or discontinued or the manufacturers just don't want to deal with the BS, CA loses gun choices every year.

  " If your MMR is going up, your winrate is better than 50%.\n\nNo, that conclusion is false. \n\nLets say you play 10 games, 5 of which you win against players with a higher MMR than yours. The other 5 games you lose against players that have exactly your MMR. Overall, your MMR went up, but you still have won 50% of your games. Sure but we're talking about the real world, not some contrived hypothetical.\n\nThis same assumption means your mmr could the same but put you at a different win rate than 50%, which also doesn't really happen.  The system just puts people of similar MMRs close together.  There isn't some grand conspiracy where it tries to keep you at 50% even if you're improving.\n\nSure it's theoretically possible but given enough games, it averages out.  Unless, as you said, you're in top GM.\n\nSo I'll say it again.  In 99% of cases, if your mmr is going up, your winrate is better than 50%.

If my opponent is in MP2 and casts a Lightning Bolt through my Chalice on X=1 and passes turn and I go to my draw phase and recognize that Bolt should've been countered, how is that different from the Goblin Guide ruling? I assume it'd be a GPE for missed trigger but I can't exactly go back and say hey, I should be up 3 more life because the Bolt would've been countered, can I? Of course, here you go!\n\n1. From IPG (2.1 Game Play Error - Missed Trigger):\n\nIf the ability was missed prior to the current phase in the previous turn, instruct the players to continue playing. If the triggered ability created an effect whose duration has already expired, instruct the players to continue playing.\n\nEdit: note that \"opponent\" here means the opponent of the controller of the ability in question.\n\nIf the triggered ability isn\u2019t covered by the previous two paragraphs [which Goblin Guide isn't], the opponent chooses whether the triggered ability is added to the stack.\n\n2. Yes, that is correct. 100% of the responsibility of triggered abilities are placed on its controller. You are never cheating by pointing out that your opponent missed a triggered ability (or not pointing it out), no matter what has happened in the meantime.\n\n3. This is different because Chalice of the Void is controlled by you. You missed the trigger, they didn't. You do not get a warning, since missing the triggered ability was bad for you in itself. The opponent will be asked if they want to put the ability on the stack, but note that the ability will do nothing anyways, since the spell it is trying to counter has already resolved.",

  "i\u2019d imagine it\u2019s the playing the percentages by consulting a big notebook of charts and tables. \n\nI.e., manager makes a decision because the chart says it will be successful 39.21% of the time vs. 37.68%.  Occasionally managers should go with their gut. I know I\u2019ve seen a few instances of puzzling choices that failed which likely were due to the manager following the book like a robot.  right on.  But mgrs have been charting and keeping notebooks since forever. Ignorant people get angry when they don't understand something and don't want to bother to at least find out what it is they hate.",
  "and flyout apparently is he also the leader in % of hits that are homers? ",
  "aptitude and opportunity do not make me smarter. Not everyone has the same potential... so even if I work hard as hell, I\u2019m still not going to achieve the same. As such, I\u2019m going to be discriminated against.   \n  \n  \nAttractive people have an easier time finding jobs and mates. How is that fair? It\u2019s not, but that\u2019s life. not everyone has the same potential [...] As such, I\u2019m going to be discriminated against.\n\nif your lack of intelligence is really that much of a hindrance, then you not getting a promotion is due to a lack of competence, not some sort of societal oppression\n\n...unless you've been diagnosed with some sort of mental disability and are being sold short because your boss thinks you won't notice. is that what you're trying to say?",
  "isn't that the truth.... I commend your continuity! \u201cOkay, but I don\u2019t need to put 30 gallons of milk into my vehicle every week just to make it to work.\u201d",
  "It's not an opinion. His style definitely changes. I never said how I felt about it. LOL, whatever you say.",
  "Thank god Marget Thatcher removed government control of coal mines in England and allowed them to be privatized. Otherwise you couldn't get them to shutdown even in the face of massive losses and pollution concerns because of conflicting interests with public coal mine unions. Abe wasn\u2019t the Tyrant we deserved, but he was the tyrant we needed",
  "In reality, two candidates are never equal, just as two products from two companies are never equal. By in capitalism, the is the assumption you don't pay more than you have to. So even if the guy produces 2x, you wouldn't pay him 3x. the problem is upper management won't pay the 2X (hell I couldn't even get them to pay the crew 1X) when they're worth it. I\n\nSpending 20 million to re-engineer a product based on lowest skill labor (pokeyoking) when you can just pay 15 million more in labor costs, saves 5 million and delivers a product that's not engineered for easy of assembly.\n\nThere's two sides to real (as opposed to crony) capitalism. Efficiency (that socialism can't compete with) and profit, and workers don't have to ask for raises because they're paid what they're worth."
