ast_hf.py
This is the same example as `ast.py`, but we will now use our
Huggingface extensions to enable a dramatic reduction in
boilerplate to rollouts.

We use GPT-2 as our attack, defense, and use the bulit-in
detoxify moderator. We will train using a manually written
corpora below of initial prompts.
