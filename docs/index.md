ASTRA-RL is a python toolbox for training and evaluating language models and generative AI systems that use textual inputs. It provides a set of tools for training, evaluating, and analyzing language models, with a focus on applying reinforcement learning based refinement techniques to improve evaluator model performance.

## Installation

To install the ASTRA-RL toolbox, you can use pip. The package is available on PyPI, so you can install it directly from there.

```bash
pip install astra-rl
```

You can then import the library in your Python code:

```python
import astra_rl
