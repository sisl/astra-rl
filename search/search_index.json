At a minimum, each node should capture:  * `context` \u2014 state so far (e.g., conversation text), * `attack` \u2014 attacker\u2019s utterance / action, * `response` \u2014 target/defender\u2019s utterance / reply, * `reward` \u2014 scalar float for this turn, * `children` \u2014 next steps; empty for leaves.  &gt; **Solver contract.** Make sure the structure and fields match what your solver consumes. &gt; \u2022 Preference-based methods (DPO/IPO/ORPO) usually want **pairs** \u2192 use `tree_width \u2265 2`. &gt; \u2022 Reward-based policy gradients (PPO/A2C) don\u2019t need pairs \u2192 `tree_width = 1` is typical.  ### 2.2 Helpful `ASTProblem` APIs  If you are using the 'ASTProblem' note these batch-friendly methods you\u2019ll typically call during rollout:  * `rollout_prompt_with_attacker(prompts: Sequence[str]) -&gt; Sequence[str]` * `rollout_prompt_with_target(prompts: Sequence[str]) -&gt; Sequence[str]` * `reward(prompts, attacks, responses) -&gt; Sequence[float]` * `advance(prompt, attack, response) -&gt; str` *(builds the next state)*  &gt; These APIs are **vectorized**\u2014pass lists (even length-1) for simplicity and speed.  ---  ## 3. Best Practices &amp; Sanity Checks  * **Prefer batch calls.** Avoid per-item model calls in tight loops. * **Determinism.** Thread a `seed` through `rollout()` for reproducibility. * **Depth/width off-by-one.** Depth `0` should produce **no** nodes; verify expected leaf counts. * **Always use `advance()`.** Even if it\u2019s simple concatenation now, it future-proofs your code. * **Context length.** Let the `Problem` handle truncation; the environment shouldn\u2019t assume token limits. * **Check your environment by printing a few rollouts.**    ```python   g = env.rollout(seed=7)   print(\"ROOT:\", g.context)   for i, n in enumerate(g.children):       print(f\"[{i}] atk={n.attack!r} rsp={n.response!r} \"             f\"rew={n.reward:.3f} children={len(n.children)}\")   ```  ---  ## 4. How-Tos  ### 4.1 Create a custom Node or Graph  Need extra metadata (e.g., per-turn safety tags, KL terms, timestamps)? Subclass `Node` to take in additional data as shown below.   <pre><code>from typing import List, Iterable, Optional, Tuple\n\n# example custom node creation\nclass CustomNode(Node[str, str]):\n    \"\"\"\n    A Node with extra per-turn metadata for evaluation/training diagnostics.\n    Compatible anywhere a plain Node is expected (isinstance(CustomNode, Node) == True).\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(\n        self,\n        context: str,\n        attack: str,\n        response: str,\n        reward: float,\n        children: Sequence[\"Node[str, str]\"],\n        *,\n        attack_tox: float = 0.0,\n        target_tox: float = 0.0,\n        attack_logprob: float = 0.0,\n    ):\n        # Initialize the base Node fields first\n        super().__init__(context, attack, response, reward, list(children))\n        # Then attach your custom metrics\n        self.attack_tox: float = float(attack_tox)\n        self.target_tox: float = float(target_tox)\n        self.attack_logprob: float = float(attack_logprob)\n</code></pre>   &gt; Keep the original fields intact so existing solvers remain compatible.  ### 4.2 Change rollout width/depth  Adjust at environment construction time:   <pre><code>from astra_rl import ASTEnvironment\n\n# 4 attacker continuations per context, depth of 2 attacker\u2013defender turns\nenv = ASTEnvironment(problem, PROMPTS, tree_width=4, tree_depth=2)\n</code></pre>   &gt; **Cost warning.** Width \u00d7 depth increases compute and memory quickly\u2014scale carefully.  ### 4.3 Multi-agent conversations  To support multi-agent conversations, you will need to query all participating models when building the rollout. This will occur in your environment (likely in modifications to __handle_rollout or rollout) but it is largely up to you on how you want to style it. For example, one approach would be to subclasses `ASTEnvironment` and override the internal expansion to call **K** defenders, combine their responses, and reduce rewards. However, you can structure how you call the agents and how you want to model rewards to fit your needs.   &gt; If you maintain the same Node type (Node(context: str, attack: str, response: str, reward: float, children: List[Node])) and return a graph, you will be able to plug into available solvers. However, deviating from this structure may require you to create a custom solver to interpret the custom rollouts and calculate loss accordingly.   &gt; Training with multiple agents multiplies compute: each node now triggers more model calls and stores more data."},{"location":"tutorials/customize_training/moderators.html","title":"How to Customize the Moderator","text":"<p>Moderators provide the training signal in LM red-teaming.
