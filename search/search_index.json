Think of it like security testing for language models - you're trying to discover vulnerabilities before they're exploited in the real world.</p> <p>ASTRA-RL automates this process using reinforcement learning. Instead of manually crafting adversarial prompts, you train a \"tester\" model to automatically generate prompts that elicit unsafe responses from your target model. This is:</p> <ul> <li>Faster than manual testing once the tester is trained</li> <li>More systematic at finding failure modes</li> <li>Scalable to large-scale evaluation</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#who-should-use-astra-rl","title":"Who Should Use ASTRA-RL?","text":"<p>This toolbox is designed for:</p> <ul> <li>Researchers studying AI safety and robustness</li> <li>ML engineers evaluating production language models</li> <li>Safety teams stress-testing conversational AI systems</li> <li>Developers building safer AI applications</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"index.html#quick-installation","title":"Quick Installation","text":"<p>To get started quickly with ASTRA-RL:</p> <pre><code>pip install astra-rl\n</code></pre> <p>Then import it in your Python code:</p> <pre><code>import astra_rl\n</code></pre> <p>For detailed installation instructions, including development setup, see the Installation Guide.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ul> <li>Modular Architecture: Easily swap components for your specific use case</li> <li>Pre-built Algorithms: Support for PPO, DPO, IPO out of the box</li> <li>Multiple Scorers: Integration with Llama-Guard 3, Detoxify, and custom scorers</li> <li>HuggingFace Compatible: Seamless integration with HuggingFace models</li> <li>Extensible Framework: Build custom systems, samplers, and solvers</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#support","title":"Support","text":"<p>If you encounter any issues or have questions:</p> <ul> <li>Check the Tutorials for common use cases</li> <li>Review the API documentation for detailed information</li> <li>Open an issue on GitHub</li> </ul>"},{"location":"contributing.html","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>Thank you for your interest in contributing to ASTRA-RL!
