This helps surface vulnerabilities and guides fine-tuning to reduce harmful outputs.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":""},{"location":"index.html#quick-installation","title":"Quick Installation","text":"<p>To get started quickly with ASTRA-RL:</p> <pre><code>pip install astra-rl\n</code></pre> <p>Then import it in your Python code:</p> <pre><code>import astra_rl\n</code></pre> <p>For detailed installation instructions, including development setup, see the Installation Guide.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#quick-links","title":"Quick Links","text":"<ul> <li>Installation Guide - Detailed installation and setup instructions</li> <li>Tutorials - Step-by-step guides for common tasks</li> <li>API Reference - Detailed documentation of all classes and functions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#key-features","title":"Key Features","text":"<ul> <li>Modular Architecture: Easily swap components for your specific use case</li> <li>Pre-built Algorithms: Support for PPO, DPO, IPO out of the box</li> <li>Multiple Moderators: Integration with Llama-Guard 3, Detoxify, and custom moderators</li> <li>HuggingFace Compatible: Seamless integration with HuggingFace models</li> <li>Extensible Framework: Build custom problems, environments, and solvers</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#documentation-structure","title":"Documentation Structure","text":"<ul> <li>Installation - Setup instructions for users and developers</li> <li>Tutorials - Learn how to use ASTRA-RL with hands-on examples<ul> <li>Quick Start Training - Train your first red-teaming model</li> <li>Quick Start Evaluation - Evaluate models with pre-trained attackers.

This environment builds a tree-structured conversation graph, where:   - The root node starts from a random initial prompt (from `PROMPTS`)   - At each turn, the attacker generates multiple (`tree_width`, default 2) candidate utterances   - Each of those utterances is fed to the target model, which produces a response   - The resulting attacker\u2013target tuples form child nodes   - This process repeats for `tree_depth` levels (default 3), yielding a multi-turn attacker\u2013target dialogue tree.    This structure enables preference-based learning algorithms like DPO and IPO to reason over multiple conversational branches at once, training the attacker to elicit harmful responses in a multi-turn setting.  <p>By default, rollouts are configured with tree_width=2 and tree_depth=3, but you can customize both:</p> <pre><code>env = ASTEnvironment(problem, PROMPTS, tree_width=4, tree_depth=5)\n</code></pre> <p>Want a different rollout graph structure or a multi-agent setup?
