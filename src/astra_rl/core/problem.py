    This class is responsible for defining how exactly to interact
    with the system under test---with generics in terms of how to get
    probabilities and rollouts from the attacker and target models.

    This allows for us to be generic over the types of states, actions
    as well as how to measure them. We ask for a moderator as a way to
    ensure that subclasses can all be generic over the exact metric, and
    instead can only be opinonated about how to achieve the metric.

    Attributes:
        moderator (Moderator[StateT, ActionT]): The moderator used to evaluate sequences.

    Generics:
        StateT (type): The type of the state in the environment.
        ActionT (type): The type of the action in the environment.
