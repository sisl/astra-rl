  "arabilized? \n\nThe arabisation of Muslims doesn't affect Singapore as much as other countries. Here arabisation usually is limited to traditions, culture and clothings ie wearing burqa when there's no sand here\n\nThat being said political views do permeate some of them.\n\nBut the arabisation of Malays in Singapore is generally less noticeable than Malays who are apathetic towards religion. They also usually are the middle aged group/older generation rather than the younger generation That is exactly what I am implying. Coordination cannot come about without good and dedicated leaders.",

Assuming the info that Edwin Tong's previous salary as a lawyer is $2M. His base pay as a SMS is plus AWS is $690K representing a 68% pay cut. At the very best if he get full bonus his salary is cap at $1.02M he would still be seeing his salary halved\n\nThose who complain that our ministers are in it for the money are either clueless or stupid.

  "You didn\u2019t even understand my original point. \n\nThe men have to pay to maintain their wives during marriage not just after. The men will have to do it whether they like it or not. While the law will no longer mandate that wives have to provide sex to their husbands whether the wives want it or not. So now the marriage exacts even more costs on men than on women hence as per my original statement, it has become a more unfair transaction for men. \n\nGo on with the condescension and name calling. You completely prove my point. Anyone who reads this exchange will now know how childish and dumb feminist arguments eventually become.  Feminism has throughout its history sought to control gender discourse through the social and political sphere. It did just that in the 70s by introducing the narrative that domestic violence is men seeking to control and oppress women - otherwise known as the Duluth model. When it was found out that women were violent towards men in almost equal numbers and that DV was mostly a two-way street, feminists stonewalled attempts to set up men's shelters, something that was already being done for women. Controlling gender discourse allows feminists to secure government funding for their various programmes and thus their source of income.\n\nA feminist organisation, in fact the largest one in the US, the National Organisation for Women, gave a woman (emma sulkowicz) an award for falsely accusing her male friend of rape.\n\nMary Koss, a prominent feminist and university professor, who has published numerous studies on rape and deliberately exaggerated numbers, was consulted by the FBI for dealing with rape, said that men cannot be raped. Here is the soundcloud.\n\nHere is the extract from the interview I linked:\n\nTheresa Phung: \"So I am actually speaking to someone right now. his story is that he was drugged, he was unconscious and when he awoke a woman was on top of him with his penis inserted inside her vagina, and for him that was traumatizing.\n\nDr. Mary P. Koss: \"Yeah.\"\n\nTheresa Phung: \"If he was drugged what would that be called?\"\n\nDr. Mary P. Koss: \"What would I call it? I would call it 'unwanted contact'.\"\n\nTheresa Phung: \"Just 'unwanted contact' period?\"\n\nDr. Mary P. Koss: \"Yeah.\"\n\nFeminism claims to be a lot of nice things. That's on paper. That's in the dictionary. The truth is far from that.\n\nNot one at the expense of another. That's what I feel feminism is\n\nYou may feel that's what feminism is, maybe from reading feminist websites or listening to feminist propaganda, but in reality that's what feminism has gone against.",

Other than receipt of purchased supplies, there isn't any proof you did it or did it correctly or is it not necessary? my understanding is that this isn\u2019t a good idea if you want to take advantage of your warranty.

  "point is, it's a show bike that is barely ridable but somehow people are being brigaded in this thread for pointing it out. I could give a shit if it has bags to raise it 2\", its not ridable and is mostly an art/style piece. I firmly land in the opinion art/style is cool, but it should also be able to still function like a bike. Which means it can turn, park, go up/down an incline and survive a speed bump. If we lower our standards to include art pieces that can barely go up and down a block without the help or three dudes to turn it around and support vehicle in tow, then it sucks donkey balls and they should have just painted it on some canvas.  only people being corrected are those that seem to think it stays at that height 24/7. \n\nNobody disagreeing with you that its a show bike, and probably handles like shit. But you could still cruise around on it, regardless of how impractical it is, or if the type of riding you can do it on it doesn't meet your criteria of what 'ridable' is.\n\nYou say shit like 'our' standards, who is that?

They monitor the battery\u2019s charge and cycle themselves off and on - idiot proof.

I sold hundreds of their little 6v Tenders to motorcyclists and watercraft guys, and I still use mine today. They work great but they\u2019ve discontinued my \u201cold faithful\u201d model.

Stators, especially on older bikes, aren\u2019t nearly as powerful as automotive alternators. \n\nC'mon man. A stator is a component of an alternator, along with the rotor.

What I can tell you is that following the instructions that come with the kind of battery charger an individual can buy will never lead to a blown-up motorcycle battery. (But, yes, setting it to max amps and leaving it connected too long will overcharge and kill the battery. Don't do that.)\n\nA trickle charger gives zero shits about the battery\u2019s status and pumps amps in \u2018til you turn it off.\n\nIt supplies voltage at the amperage you set it to. Yes, you can overcharge the battery and that will kill it, but that's why you read the instructions.

  "i'd like to make it clear that I never said religion was bad. God advocates love above all and shit like that. I think it's a tool for nationalists and dictators to more easily control countries. More controversial topics like abortion/gay marriage are classically opposed by Christians in the US, and I think the GOP abuses the religious vote on these topics.\nI don't think denying all religion is more radical than believing a single (collection of) books with little to know outside confirmation is the ultimate truth to the universe. We have observed evolution of bacteria. We have Darwin's finches (Darwin was a Christian til his death). We have so much peer reviewed repeatable evidence that we emerged out of chaos, and 1 collection to say otherwise.\n\nSo, with all due respect I'm kind of confused here. Our conversation started by my saying that people not being Christian is ultimately because of God's gift of perseverance from election, while you said it's from reason. I asked how that's the case, then you explained the evolutionary advantage of religion in our early days compared to the potential to become more cosmopolitan and such. Are you saying that this is why you're not religious or is it more a general problem with religion independent of that? \n\nIf that's not the reason, what would your objection to Christianity be? \n\nI don't think you can argue the morals of wanting to stop climate change and human rights abuse. If you have a reason then shoot though.\n\nWell, my point goes further than that. You hold certain things as good (I do too), but if they're good, there needs to be a standard that makes it so. What would your standard be?  yeah after re-reading I never really answered the question, rather gave support for what my answer would be. \n\nReligion helped us go from animals to people. Our minds seem to be not content with mystery. Back in the day we wanted an answer to why we are here. That answer for a long time was a god put us here. Reason comes into play when we have scientific evidence saying humans resulted from big bang atoms chaos physics and plenty of time in between. \n\nWhat I believe is that we don't need an answer of why we're here anymore, we know. And it's a depressing truth. I think hanging on to a religion constantly being challenged by science, with the only evidence being one collection of books, is a lack of reason. \n\nMy basis for right/wrong does not come from a single source (I'll reiterate that the only evidence is one book), rather from a mix of cosmopolitan and socialistic philosophy and admittedly personal or selfish philosophy. \n\nIs that a bit more clear?",
  " 20:13\n\nDoes that verse seem like it is up for interpretation?\n\n\n i understand it. I just think it\u2019s a way to justify hypocrisy.",
  "forgot about this comment.\n\nI'll put it this way, Job's wife's words are highly ambiguous especially since we can't say for sure whether the authors intended for her to say \"bless God and die\" or \"curse God and die.\" (Every time you see the word \"curse\" the Hebrew actually says bless in the prose section of Job at least. The thinking is that the authors were too pious to even say \"curse\" in a way that might be misconstrued)\n\nFurthermore, when you get into the history of interpretation (which is very rich when it comes to Job) Job's wife is portrayed in a variety of complex lights. For instance, in the testament of Job, she is portrayed as both being a bit vain, but also sacrificing everything and working hard to support Job. Augustine was really the first one to start popularizing the whole \"Job's wife was an agent of the devil\" view. But this has never been the only view, or even necessarily the general consensus view on Job's wife.\n\nFor instance, Louis Ginsberg points out that Job's wife seems to be saying something along the lines of \"die with your integrity intact before your suffering causes you to lose your integrity.\"\n\nMy Hebrew Bible professor developed his argument (though it may have been his professor, He went to Princeton not terribly long ago, so I'm sure if you wanted to see if it originated with one of his professors you could see who taught Hebrew Bible at Princeton in the last 25-20 years and see if one of them makes this argument) because he views Job's wife as a foil for Job's friends, and the fact that Job rebukes his wife, whereas God rebukes Job's friends, also plays into that foil. yeah. Caryl covers those arguments, including the Jewish legend that Job's wife is Dinah (interesting). I'm from a tradition of presenting multiple possibilities, and then picking one and running with with. I pick that Job's wife was tempting him, which given her circumstances, I totally understand. Who could go through what they went through and maintain integrity? Not many. But I understand the other points of view.",

So it always just works. \n\nFor example: Woman- Oh thank the lord for sparing us from the hurricane, he saved our home and family and answered our prayers! He is almighty and listens to our prayers.\n\nKid- But Mom I just saw on the news that 700 people died from this hurricane not far from here, why didn\u2019t God answer their prayers? \n\nWoman- We\u2019ll honey thats just part of Gods plan. He\u2019s just in his actions and I have faith that he did that for a justified reason. \n\nKid- But Mom Why is killing all those kids and people and destroying their homes okay? \n\nWoman-  I\u2019m not sure honey just have faith that it is.  \n\n\n\nHonestly I\u2019m very open. Maybe one day I\u2019ll get a really solid answer as to how one can reach such a claim and live their life by it. Justifying their belief in prejudice amongst other things. \n\nAlmost as if believing in God or religion or the belief in faith you get a free pass on the truth card.  Because we certainly use absolute truths and not faith for almost everything else in our lives.  But this one topic widely has a wildly different approach. \n\nThanks! ",

Regardless of classification it is absolutely associated with military use and killing people, and as a result i completely support banning it. So essentially yes, because it is a little different under the covers, but very different in intent, i support banning it. Handguns in a similar vein i support banning from civilians. And at the end of the day, most Canadians are similar to me and would be considered uninformed, as you indicate i am. As such the argument for not restricting these weapons needs to be something better than \"i want my guns, free country, its the same as a hunting weapon\", because none of those arguments carry any weight with those of us not intimate with guns who very clearly put peoples lives ahead of a hobby that most of us believe should be satisfied by Call of Duty.",

Years of overcharges by one of those other delivery companies. Never CP, mind. I believe the funding cuts were in reference to the changes to community boxes over home delivery.

You should get pretty much the same results if you're only using Exotic gear.\n\nI've never used a Greatsword on a Mesmer in all honesty, but all I know is that Sword main-hand and Sword/Focus off-hand are *very* strong. The Focus gives you the ability to pull 5 mobs in who are widely spread out, and the Sword(off-hand) gives you the hardest hitting Phantasm, as well as a block/counter (skill 4) which deals a very significant amount of damage.\n\nI've seen a lot of PvP videos where Mesmers 1-shot people with a Greatsword, but since I've never played around with it I don't really know how effective it is in open-world. But taking the Greatsword means you'll either be losing the Focus pulls or the extreme Sword off-hand damage. I tried it out for a few minutes today and it seems a lot better than the build I was trying to run. I hadn't really messed with Sword/Sword before, it's a lot stronger than I thought.

If you add it only to specific content then you only have it there. Also, you would always have to teleport there and back again when you want to read something.",
  " we could even see the return of Scarlet herself as a ghost\n\nThat would be very cool - to see what she has to say about the death of Modremoth. Speaking of which, WHERE'S MY BOY TRAHEARN. I was hoping to see him,  after having visited that orrian rift. Would have been nice to have some real closure (Knight of the thorn quest being only Caladbolg's memories)\n\nOne problem though is where the writers draw the line between who we can see and cannot see in the mists. It's a whole can of worms they opened. Maybe they should explain a bit more about what allows a spirit to cross over from the Mists to Tyria and what the limitations of these apparitions are. depending on how they handle sylvari afterlives (so far we only saw displaced sylvari spirits in the Domain of the Lost, but that seemed to be because of Balthazar's shenanigans disrupting the realms), we could see Trahearne's spirit actually meeting and joining forces with Glint. I imagine a tactical genius, scholar and fierce necromancer such as Trahearne would be a nice asset in Glint's great war campaign against Kralkatorrik and actually give us and Trahearne real closure instead of us just meeting Caladbolg's Dream version of Trahearne who was close to the real deal but not quite the one and only Big T. :)\n\nWe've been told in Hall of Chains raid that Dhuum has been feasting on some souls for quite some time, and he apparently sent Eaters of Souls to different realms to gather magic for him, but with his sealing and the falls of the Eaters there's no telling what might happen next. We saw Gwen's spirit survive Dhuum's onslaught, so theoretically other notable human spirits might've survived too, especially now that they're under new management (still unsure who leads Fissure of Woe with Balthy being gone, though, but that might be explored in a future raid). And if Dhuum never got to the other races' afterlives, we could theoretically meet any race's dead if ANet deems it suitable for story.\n\nSome rifts between Tyria's land of the living and the Mists form when mass deaths occur in this or that region as apparently collective soul magic and suffering cause imbalance. We also had the curious artifact Eternal Flame in Citadel of Flame explorable which allowed the recently dead to return to life before we destroyed it and banished Gaheron's spirit to the Mists, so if any other such non-Six Gods artifacts (presumably) exist, who knows what shenanigans might occur. Then there's the Grenthian ritual as seen with Alastia Crow which allowed priests of Grenth to summon a spirit to the land of the living for a while as well as attracting hostile Mist entities with them.\n\nAs long as Kralky keeps opening rifts all over the place, theoretically any spirit could try passing over and would successfully do so for a short while until the rifts are closed as seen with Snaff and Eir. If we go into the Mists themselves, then a whole world of possibilities opens for us as we've seen long-gone figures like Primevals still keep fighting there, and seeing spirits who have been gone for over a decade (like Snaff) being just fine...not sure if Glint pulled his spirit from the Domain of the Lost or the asuran afterlife, but apparently there's some way for spirits to appear even when most go to their designated afterlives which aren't in contact (as suggested by the bittersweet love story of the human and norn spirit who refused to move on in order to stay together in \"The Departing\").\n\nAnd yes, it would be nice to see the narrative designers expand on the afterlife and spirit concepts in Tyrian lore if they feel ambitious enough to tackle such. It's one of the more mysterious parts of the lore and has continued to be so since the writings about Lord Odran and his involvement with ghosts. :)",

  " Premiums for families have increased for a majority, a lot by  50% or more.\n\nI said it lowered the effective cost of health care, I didn't talk about premiums. That's saying \"we have to pay more taxes as more hospitals declared costs\", which would have the same effect, you just wouldn't know about it.\n\nThis is not hard to get.\n\n The only way there can be no competition is if government makes it so. If government creates to many laws and regulations, then government creates the monopoly.\n\nMonopolies are naturally created through capitalism, I have given enough examples in my original reply. The 'free market' in the USA compared to EU enforces this even more (fundemental difference in what a free market is, singular information flow comapred to a required bi-directional information flow).\n\nHow is the internet / phone service over there? Broken up, few years later, same issues. Monopolies. It only took a few years to get to the exact same toxic state. If a new player wants entry, lets say Google, it isn't the goverment intervening, it is capitalism being able to bribe their way further.\n\nCapitalism is founded on greed, greed finds a way into the goverment.\n\nThis doesn't make capitalism bad (you americans love black and white...), this means there are drawbacks behind a natural driving force. Greed is good as a driving force, but it requires checks.\n\n There is no incentive for customers to take care of themselves or only get treatments they need. All places that have healthcare like this ration their services.\n\nYes there is, this is a very delusional and close minded way to look at health care. Case in point, the far majority of european countries.\n\n Canada has wait times of  2 months for things like cat scans and the NHS in britain is starting to prevent overweight people from visiting hospitals.\n\nOw noo, people are making use of health care, shame on them! Nothing wrong with wait lists, as long as they are kept in check. It means machines are used cost effectively, a good thing.\n\n Socialism has killed 100's of millions of people in the 20th century.\n\nReligion killed more than anything in history, 78% of Americans are christians. This information is completely useless, just as the quote above.\n\nLook up what this term actually means, socialism co-exists with capitalism just fine, in fact they empower each other. This is again a very american, black and white view of the word, which isn't used in any western country for decades.\n\nBy nature an american will shy away from this word, or look at it as 'baaaad', while Europeans are fine with it, as they might actually understand the meaning behind it. Every western european country has a socialist nature, we also have less poverty, universal health care and some countries even have universal basic income. I must be terrified right now, we gonna kill each other any minute now!\n\nTry to find a middle line in your views. It isn't gun control = bad or = good. Capitalism = good = bad, more often than not when 2 persons are telling their story, the truth is in the middle.\n\n You are obviously a teenager who has no real understanding of how the world works.\n For you to advocate for such things either makes you uninformed / ignorant or incredibly stupid\n\nLeave these silly insults at home, 80$ salted water bags, keep it going bud.

  "sort of, yes. The space for the strong interactions is called color. The space for the electromagnetic interaction is charge. The space for the the unified electroweak force is is a product space of electroweak isospin (the SU(2) part) and the electroweak hypercharge (the U(1) part) . In general it is the associated charge. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)\n\nThe actual colors are arbitrary labels that can\u2019t be fixed unless a symmetry is broken, and even then, only under convention (we call electrons negative charges, arbitrarily)\n\nFor the strong force, the colors are not observable\u2014 there\u2019s no way to create a fixed source of \u201cRed\u201d charge, so calling them red, green, and blue is an entirely fictitious way of keeping track without enumerating them.\n\nAnti-red is not an additive complement to red, though. Rather, it is the dual representation. The consequence is that there is a sub space of the color-anticolor product space that is invariant under the group transformation \u2014 this state corresponds to a neutral combination of color/anti color particles. It\u2019s not red-antired, blue-antiblue, or green-antigreen.

  "Well....typically the largest driver for staffing is meeting minimum ops/security staffing, and having sufficient staff for emergency response purposes. Emergency response requirements drives a large amount of minimum staffing. Those positions are used and needed for other stuff though. \n\nIt\u2019s really hard to say without going into the nitty gritty details. From a pure legal perspective, you have to maintain the stuff above. Minimum operations staffing is typically 3 senior reactor operators, a shift technical advisor/engineer, at least 3 field operators, 2 rad techs, a chemistry tech, and 1 or 2 maintenance techs. Like that\u2019s bare minimum. Plus you also need a fire brigade staffed (we use field operators for it at my station, but it\u2019s different everywhere). \n\nBut you have a ton of required maintenance you have to do, much of which is regulatory driven. You have Engineering, which you need a full time technical staff because you literally can\u2019t change lightbulb designs without a 100 page change package (seriously.....took a colleague of mine almost 2 months to change the approved design for light bulbs in the plant to switch to LEDs). Then you get new regulatory stuff, or INPO/fleet requirements and projects, and it becomes overwhelming. \n\nOne big thing that hurts, is the nrc has kind of extended their oversight outside of the reactor system. Example: if you have a turbine control valve fail which causes a reactor scram, the nrc can give you violations for that. Even though the plant is designed to be safe in that condition explicitly, the fact that you failed to do adequate preventative maintenance on a power generation asset which led to a reactor scram is a violation of maintenance rule. You never lost a safety function, never lost operability if any license required system, but it\u2019s still an issue. So you have all this required preventative maintenance you have to do in the power production side of the plant which anywhere else you would just run to failure or until a major scheduled maintenance outage. \n\n I see, that makes a lot of sense.\n\nI do wonder why the \"green energy\" crowd never pushes nuclear though.  Id think that at this point, emitting carbon is worse for us than generating nuclear waste.",
  "You cannot assign a time to them, either. Anything beyond the CEH is ill-defined in yours - however, if events occur when they causally do, those objects effectively don't exist, as they are not observable.

  "unlike what is presented in the gif, I know the photon exists in 3D space and has electric and magnetic component fields which induce one another to allow propagation. Other than that, is it missing anything else? the EM wave shown also has an associated \"photon number\" observable. As usual in QM, this observable is not a single number, but rather there is a probability distribution describing the number of photons with an associated average and standard deviation. In fact, there is also quantum uncertainty associated with other observables (like the amplitude of the electric and magnetic field) which are well-defined classically.",
  "OK, interesting. I somehow thought the orbit would be less stable.\n\nUnlikely that plastics will last so long. Bacteria are evolving to break down some types of it already. Metals can stay for a long time. We should add glass to the list.\n\nReally depends on the exact material. There is no large scale breaking down of plastic by bacteria yet afaik. Most ends up in ocean sediment now. Some metals last long, others not so much. Glass isn't too bad.\n\nIn the geological record you'd also find traces of C14 and other radioactive isotopes if they had atomic bombs. And much more actually.

  " And by the way the comic was nowhere near that, what are you talking about?\n\nThe 'sambo-style' is a type of pickanniny style. Sambo was actually a native american. This is irrelevant to the point at hand.\n\nOf course it matters, you're basically saying that as long as enough people arbitrarily decide to get offended by something then the author's intent doesn't matter.\nI'm being more pragmatic than ideological here. Assume Mark Knight made the cartoon with no racial consideration at all. His *intention* was to highlight the dummy-spit, but the result was a lot of very angry people who felt racially vilified. Many of those people have stopped listening, and won't accept any 'explanations' contrary to their initial perception. The damage has been done. The road to hell is paved with good intentions.\n\n When's the last time anyone from the left has altered their behaviour, language, etc... based on people from the right saying they are offended? And yet the right's supposed to fall right into lockstep and kowtow to the left's every whim just because enough lefties are claiming to be offended? Why?\n\nThis is not really part of the discussion, but I actually agree. The problem is that the social-right holds conservative values that can be quite bigoted against people of certain races, sexuality, gender, culture, nationality, or faith. I would say that most of those are beyond the individual's control, and should not be the target of ridicule\u2014that'd be playing the man, not the ball. It isn't always wrong to offend, if the person is espousing certain well-regarded qualities while living the opposite. Barnaby Joyce's little saga is a solid example: talking about strong family values while undermining them at every turn.\n\nI am happy to agree that there are plenty shrill and deranged voices on the left being offended by every little thing. Such people exist on both sides of the social spectrum and make a lot of noise that will often drown out meaningful discourse. They will dismiss anything the other person has to say unless they completely agree with them. The sane part of society can actually discuss whether an offensive thing is warranted criticism or not. Criticisms based in race are not warranted, and that is what Mark Knight unintentionally achieved. He fucked up, and the correct move would have been to acknowledge the similarities between the cartoon and the sambo-style and to apologise for the reaction it has caused because he had only intended to illustrate the childish and, frankly, thuggish behaviour of Serena Williams. Instead he and the Herald Sun have opted for the more *courageous* move of doubling down.  This is not really part of the discussion, but I actually agree. The problem is that the social-right holds conservative values that can be quite bigoted against people of certain races, sexuality, gender, culture, nationality, or faith.\n\nYou're just looking for excuses to hold a double standard.

  "not so certain it's new, Andrew Poelstra has been talking about Scriptless Script for a few years now.  The important insight is that the clever construction of adaptor signatures leads to something that acts like a hashlock (except only those involved in the protocol learn the equivalent of preimage) and first signing a later transaction with a valid `nLockTime` before signing the transaction that commits funds is equivalent to a CLTV, resulting in a hashlocked timelocked contract (HTLC) that is not expressed in SCRIPT.  The hope is that similar constructions will work for more complicated SCRIPT usages.  Yes it does. Every transaction contains executable scripts\n\nIt's unfortunate that Bitcoin Script works this way, because there isn't really any need for it to. What you call \"execution\" would be better thought of as \"verification of an execution\", and there are many cases where these are different (and the verification is cheaper and more private than the execution).\n\nAs a simple example, verifying an ECDSA signature can be thought of as \"verifying the execution\" of the signing algorithm.\n\nA more subtle example is the use of `OP_IF` with an explicit 0/1 input passed to indicate which branch to take. In ordinary programming you'd never see an explicit \"take this branch\" flag alongside an if-statement, because the point is to react differently to different conditions. In Bitcoin, a script pubkey has many conditions which might satisfy it, but at spending time, the precise condition is known, and validators only need to care about the semantics of the specific condition that gets used.\n\nHad Satoshi thought in these terms he might have invented MAST, which AFAIK came from Russell O'Connor in 2010 or so. This is the idea that you replace `OPIF`/`OPELSE` with a Merkle tree committing to all the different \npossibilities, and at spend-time you reveal only the one that gets used.\n\nThe idea behind scriptless scripts, mentioned a few posts down, is that you can go even further and only reveal the script to the counterparties of the transaction, publishing to the blockchain only a \"proof\" that the script was satisfied. In practice, there are a lot of constructions where this proof consists of a single Schnorr signature.\n\nSegwit makes a small move in this direction by replacing the \"scriptSig\" (literally, a \"signature\" with opcodes that verifiers have to execute) with a \"witness stack\" (directly pushing the output of the scriptSig). Long before Segwit, non-push opcodes had been considered nonstandard in script signatures.",

  "i consider sidechains to be any blockchain that has some mechanism to peg its value to some coin that is native to another blockchain, called the mainchain, often requiring some support in the mainchain that hosts the coin natively.\n\nThe sidechain defines some rules for transferring that coin within its own chain, and some rules for how a mainchain coin can be somehow locked (which triggers the creation of a pegged version on it on the sidechain; this is the main-to-side peg) and, if you can prove ownership of the equivalent amount within the sidechain, to unlock the mainchain coin (the side-to-main peg).\n\nAs originally conceived in the original sidechains paper, a \"classic\" sidechain has its blockchain secured via proof-of-work.  Coins are locked on the mainchain (main-to-side peg) by putting them in a special contract (SCRIPT) which requires an SPV proof of the sidechain, and unlocking the coin (side-to-main peg) requires fulfilling that contract.  Elements Alpha I believe uses this style.\n\nRootstock uses proof-of-work (I think?) to secure its blockchain.  Main-to-side peg is done by paying to an m-of-n multisig, where the n signatories are members of the supposedly-distributed Rootstock Federationm which then releases the equivalent amount within the sidechain.  The Side-to-main peg is done by paying sidecoin to a similar m-to-n multisig on the sidechain, then triggering the Rootstock Federation to release the equivalent amount from its controlled UTXOs on the mainchain.\n\nLiquid is similar to the above except its blockchain is secured by a fixed m-of-n signatory set in the Liquid Federation.\n\nDrivechains secures the sidechain by merge-mining it with the mainchain (although in theory it would be possible to use a different security model for the side blockchain).  Main-to-side pegs pay to a special contract on the mainchain that can only be spent by miner voting.  Side-to-main pegs require somehow requesting a majority of miners to vote for unlocking of some amount on the mainchain that was locked to that sidechain, on the assumption that miners are actually also validating the sidechain in addition to the mainchain (how that is a scaling solution is a big question: it has the same rough effects as a miner-controlled blocksize increase).\n\n-----\n\nBefore the original sidechains paper, people had already discussed the possibility of some kind of proof-of-burn on Bitcoin, and then using the proof-of-burn on the Bitcoin blockchain on a different blockchain that would magically create a \"pegged Bitcoin\" on its own blockchain.  The main context was scaling across the solar system, I believe (burn some earth-based Bitcoin to set up the Mars Bitcoin blockchain, something like that).  This had no mechanism to return the coins to the original Bitcoin blockchain, so if the value of the sidecoin drifted below the maincoin, nothing would force them back to parity. In designing how to construct a secure proof-of-burn, however, Pieter Wuille (?) realized that the verification of the proof-of-burn could also be implemented on the original Bitcoin blockchain too, not just on the other blockchain, so that it *should* be possible to burn the other blockchain's coin and present this proof-of-burn on the Bitcoin blockchain, leading to a two-way peg. That was rather extensive and provided much illumunation. Thank you for taking the time to write that.\n\nWe need a video with some visual graphics to go along with this for my brain to fully soak it in, I think.",
  " CZ needs to have a serious chat with him to fix this\n\n*\"You're fired\"* Simple. OP has been scammed and is refusing to accept this fact. It has nothing to do with binance. He has posted multiple posts saying he has done skype video chats with \"binance support\" and refuses to post email headers confirming it was actually binance who told him to talk to them through skype.\n\nBinance doesnt do skype support. He has been giving all his personal information, including his face on webcam, to scammers, and now he's blaming binance. It is very unfortunate this happened to OP, but repeatedly trying to shame binance for something they are not at fault for will accomplish nothing.\n\nEdit: Ever since OP had that skype call two weeks ago there has most likely been multiple different people with every last bit of his personal information trying to get binance to unfreeze that account. He should be doing whatever the fuck he can to keep that account frozen instead he has posted 6 posts on 3 different subreddits saying binance stole his money. If his account has been kept frozen for this time he should be thanking binance profously yet here is doing all he can to give binance bad publicity instead of listening to all the people telling him what he did wrong so that he might help binance move forward with this.\n\nOP you needed to start doing damage control 2 weeks ago. You need to create a new email. The scammers not only have all your personal information you gave them, they know what email adress you use. You also should never again use or create an exchange account linked to any of those documents you sent them. If youre using any other exchanges get your money out of there now.",

I'm going glass half empty here, and saying that I don't think most bm places made sure users knew ohms law . Battery safety. That the limits on their battery could be wildly off of what the actual performance was. \n\nThe people that didn't know however, I don't think are the majority of the people that got hurt. I think, just me in my own mind (feel free to disagree), most people got hurt by carrying bare batteries in their pockets and mechs with other shit in there that depressed the button  Can't disagree at all, that's exactly what happened. These devices became popular and people bought them like crazy without knowing much about how they work and what risks they brought with them. Then some folks got hurt.\n\nThis isn't really much different than any other home-made tech, like drones for instance. Hobbyists made drones for themselves and sold expensive kits to other hobbyists with more money than time, and everyone pretty much used them responsibly. Then companies started mass producing them cheaply, consumers start buying them for their kids for Christmas and using them irresponsibly, and now you've got stories about peeping Tom drones, injured people, drone-based drug trafficking at the border, and all kinds of local legislation and the FAA making regulations\u2026 \n\nIn 1992 you couldn't make a cellphone in your garage, because you couldn't make your own network of cell towers. That's always been corporate tech and corporations put a lot of engineering resources into how to avoid class-action lawsuits. I think either the expectations of safety regarding vaping need to change or the actual safety of the devices needs to change. And, well, I'm pretty sure only one of those options is really possible.",

That does make the most amount of sense and its just my mind holding me back. I came to vaping to quit cigarettes, both for the health reasons and the cost. \n\nSo, even though vaping is healthier (or rather, less bad) than smoking, my goal is to quit by February thus I don't want to sink too much in to mods. \n\nTo make it all even more fun I am extremely particular about the anesthetics of the mod and layout of the buttons, bordering on obsessive compulsive, and all the designs I can tolerate are a year old at best so finding them for sale is tough. \n\nIn all, I just make this over complicated for myself.

  "okay.\n\nHave a good evening.  identifying as a \"Nazi atheist\" (because the grandfather was a Nazi)\n\nI'm unaware that the Nazi label is passed on this way and will find it strange. Aryan might be fine besides the associated historical baggage. \n\nlegitimate and meaningful forms of atheism\n\nThis is the problem if you believe that \"jewish atheist\" is supposed to represent a \"form of atheism\". The way I see it, describing oneself as an atheist can go along with any other description, perhaps with the only exception of \"theist atheist\". One can be American, Canadian, black, white, Indonesian, Kenyan, golfer, gamer, gambler, Martian atheist and so on. However, in contexts where the \"atheist\" label is brought up, many of these other labels are irrelevant to the discussion and are therefore never mentioned.\n\nJewish is different. The term indicates relationship to a specific group of people commonly and exclusively associated with one specific well-defined religion. Therefore in the context of discussing religion, it is perfectly fine to add the label to indicate one's knowledge about the background of the associated culture and religion, as well as to indicate the non-adherence to the typical religion.",

  "the issue I have is that atheists want to include a bunch of people in their label that would not identify themselves as atheists (such as the irreligious and agnostics)\n\nIf they don't identify as atheist then don't call them one.\n\n   I do not disagree that it is valid or coherent... I also think atheists like the definition because it boosts their numbers, and in the confusion helps their arguments. \n\nAtheists use the definition because it makes the most sense. Also, we don't need to stir up confusion to form valid arguments, this is merely an accusation, which you've already personally contradicted by accepting that the definition is coherent. So which is it, confusing or coherent? You seem to want to have it both ways here, and like you are the one trying to obfuscate. \n\n He specifically has said that he does not consider himself an atheist\n\nThen we won't call him one.\n\n but your definition would include him. \n\nIt's not *my* definition, it is the one that is commonly accepted. If he doesn't want to be defined as such then that's his business, and we won't refer to him as such. NDT's main opposition to the word is just due to the fact that it comes with some baggage, but if he does not believe in any theistic gods then technically he is a non-theist, which is just another way of saying atheist. But we'll stick with non-theist because he doesn't like the label of atheist.\n\n I think your definition is overbroad, and is not accepted by at least  half the people you cover with it.  I doubt most apatheists or agnostics  want the label atheist. \n\nYes, you \"think\" and you \"doubt\" which is all well and good, you can think whatever you want. Most of the people I know who use these labels understand they are not mutually exclusive to atheism, and include themselves within that subset as well.  If they don't identify as atheist then don't call them one.\n\nI don't.  It is usually atheists that are calling them atheists.\n\nAtheists use the definition because it makes the most sense. \n\nI totally disagree.  Exhibit 1 is the massive amount of arguments and disagreements on these forums about the new atheist's definition of atheism (such as this one).\n\nSo which is it, confusing or coherent?\n\nI think the definition is coherent, even if it is bad, and less definitive, clear, or widely used as my definition.  I think atheists use confusing arguments when talking about things surrounding the topic (like discussions about burdens of proof).  \n\nThen we won't call him one.\n\nHe would be one by your definition.  Thus, you called him one.\n\nIt's not my definition, it is the one that is commonly accepted.\n\nMassively incorrect.  It is commonly accepted by new atheists, some people in academia, and that's about it.  It is nowhere even close to the common definition.  Ask 100 people on the street to define atheism, and I bet you 95 will say something close to my definition, 2 will say something closer to yours, and 3 will say they don't know, or something random.\n\n NDT's main opposition to the word is just due to the fact that it comes with some baggage\n\nYes, it does.  And so does Christianity.  We have to accept that baggage, not change the definitions of the words because we don't like them.\n\nMost of the people I know who use these labels understand they are not mutually exclusive to atheism, and include themselves within that subset as well.\n\nThis is called 'anecdotal evidence', and is completely invalid, and obviously biased.",

Of course we see evolution carried out. That's not what I was referring to.\n\nAnd either way, that\u2019s not what the imago dei even means. We don\u2019t physically look like God; God is immaterial.\n\nIn the loosest interpretation, yes. However, this depends on who you talk to - again, this was from my annotated catholic bible. I don't claim that it's the authority on catholic teachings, but the teachings of different churches and different scholars can be fairly diverse even within Catholicism. It is also important to recognize that this is one of the passages that directly influences how many modern Christians view evolution and how it might have been \"guided\" by God.",

  "okay, I thought I was done but this was actually illuminating, so I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve yet hit the impasse which I originally perceived. \n\nI'm enjoying this. Nice. \n\nHere\u2019s Caltech theoretical physicist Sean Carroll with a long but fascinating talk on this and other related subjects. \n\nI really like Sean Carroll. Haven't heard this talk before, but I know him from many other places. Thanks, this was inspiring. But I still have some issues with that regarding this topic. I know Carroll does not like metaphysics, but this important.\n\nFirst causality could be still fundamental. We could still say, Laws of Physics aren't fundemantal but emergent out of the behavior of the fundamental particles or wave functions and whatever. We could still say that particles cause each other to behave in a way and we describe it as a law. \n\nThe other way, which I find very intriguing, says that our particles just behave according to the laws of physics. They don't cause each other. We cannot find any direction of causality. They just act in that way, because of the laws of physics. But there's still in elephant in the room. In that view, the laws of physics cause the particles to behave in a certain way. You still have causality. Causality is still fundamental. \n\nAnd although this is not the point of the debate, I'd like to add, that this is also a pretty good argument for the existence of God. The laws of physic are everywhere in the universe (omnipresent), outside of time and space, the control every particle in the universe (omnipotent) and there are some good arguments that they are finely-tuned  (intentional). Just wanted to put that out there. \n\nBut back to the actual point. You still have fundamental causality. You cannot escape that, because the very act of explaining requires causes. This is what science does, just as our everyday thought. \n\n\nDo you not believe that an objective reality really exists within which people may interact? \n\nThis was not about what I believe. I just wanted to show that you can have a worldview, which is not contradicted by your thought experiment in any way, that still allows Free Will. And I think there are many Idealist worldviews that would do that. The pragmatist one, that I showed you, has almost no axioms. And it is completely compatable with science and also everyday life. But also with religion and spirituality. This is not exactly what I would belief. I personally belief in an objective reality. But still I'm an idealist. I don't think that matter, time or anything could exist outside of consciousness. Because no one has ever experienced or seen that. \n\nThe moment you acknowledge the necessity of acting as though objective reality exists, you validate the axioms of the thought experiment. The thought experiment is not contingent on consciousness emerging from matter. It is only contingent on a shared, objective context which we can empirically observe. It seems to me that even idealism acknowledges this shared context, unless you want to devolve into a vegetative state of solipsistic inaction. \n\nThe described worldview does not see objective reality as a necessity, but as helpful. It might be helpful, sometimes to assume not a completly objective reality. (Which you could give other good arguments for, because every analysis of reality is filtered through meaningful interpretation. But this is another topic.)\n\nAnd still your thought experiment fails at option 3. You don't have to subscribe to probabalism or pure randomness. You could still have selfdetermined things, that appear from the outside as probabilistic or random. I have not yet seen where you have proven that this cannot be the case.\n\nWhen you try to describe everything with laws, of course you cannot have free will. Free is the opposite of law. Free will is something that by definition cannot be further explained or examined. But is it impossible for something to exist, that we can only broadly understand and never examine? That does not mean that free will violates the laws of physics or is not in harmony with them. It could be just a part of the universe that we only can have access to, by our own expirience of it.\n\nIt's the same with consciousness. Have you ever seen it in the universe? But nobody would deny that it exists.   First causality could be still fundamental. We could still say, Laws of Physics aren't fundemantal but emergent out of the behavior of the fundamental particles or wave functions and whatever. We could still say that particles cause each other to behave in a way and we describe it as a law. \n\n The other way, which I find very intriguing, says that our particles just behave according to the laws of physics. They don't cause each other. We cannot find any direction of causality. They just act in that way, because of the laws of physics. But there's still in elephant in the room. In that view, the laws of physics cause the particles to behave in a certain way. You still have causality. Causality is still fundamental. \n\nI think I agree with this assessment, but you\u2019re skipping over important implications. Yes, the laws of physics \u201ccause\u201d things to move in a pattern, so that is a sense in which causality is fundamental. But the directional causality of preceding events unto resulting events isn\u2019t conserved with this definition. The necessity of a \u201cfirst cause\u201d or \u201cunmoved mover\u201d in a chain of events is not conserved. All that is conserved is the idea that particles and forces are arranged in a pattern throughout spacetime, and that pattern is determined by the laws of physics. It is causality in a way, but it\u2019s a very different idea of causality. \n\n But back to the actual point. You still have fundamental causality. You cannot escape that, because the very act of explaining requires causes. This is what science does, just as our everyday thought. \n\nI sense that you\u2019ve moved back from the fundamental, laws-of-physics-creating-a-pattern type of causality to the Aristotelian type of causality with this. That jump isn\u2019t warranted. While it may be true that at the fundamental levels, the laws of physics cause the patterns we see around us, and at our macro level, we see that prior events cause later events, it is not accurate to say that, at fundamental levels, prior events cause later events. Scientific explanation and everyday thought use that type of prior-event/ resulting-event causality because it\u2019s a useful fiction. It\u2019s not fair to draw metaphysical implications from that useful fiction, though. \n\n I just wanted to show that you can have a worldview, which is not contradicted by your thought experiment in any way, that still allows Free Will \n\n And still your thought experiment fails at option 3. You don't have to subscribe to probabalism or pure randomness. You could still have selfdetermined things, that appear from the outside as probabilistic or random. I have not yet seen where you have proven that this cannot be the case.\n\nLet me try to explain again why option 3 of the thought experiment is synonymous with true randomness. Let\u2019s grant the existence of a soul and say that it is the uncaused cause of its own will. It causes that will as an event in spacetime. \n\nNow, there are only two (very broad) variables involved in the soul\u2019s decision: 1) the nature of the soul, and 2) the state of its environmental inputs. If both variables 1amp;2 are identical in multiple simulations or \u201creplays\u201d of the same moment, and different states of will result, the *only* explanation of the differing results is probability. The nature of the soul and its environment are perfectly identical in each of the multiple iterations, so what possible explanation of different resulting wills could exist besides probability? I would argue none. \n\nIf the nature of the soul and the state of its environment reliably produce the same resulting will in each iteration, then we must say that the will is a deterministic result of the soul\u2019s nature and the environment in which it operates. If the nature of the soul and the state of its environment do not produce the same resulting will in each iteration, we must say that the will is a probabilistic result of the soul\u2019s nature and the environment in which it operates. \n\nTo claim that the exact same variables producing different outcomes in each replay is \u201cfreedom\u201d rather than randomness is to stick your head in the sand. You claim that it only looks random from the outside but is truly self-determined and free. I claim that self-determination *is* true randomness, and therefore should not be called self-determination at all. It\u2019s not a logical concept. You say I haven\u2019t proven that there is a true dichotomy between determinism and probabilism, but I starkly disagree. I think you\u2019re looking at probabilism and saying \u201cthat\u2019s freedom\u201d due to motivated reasoning. It\u2019s an illogical claim, but a comforting one. \n\nYou can claim that the soul determined its own nature in that moment by its own free choices in previous moments, but you can\u2019t just stop there. I\u2019ll grant that the soul\u2019s choices affect its future nature, but you have to keep following that chain of events all the way back to when the soul was first formed. What determined its original nature? Well, maybe its creator, or maybe it just spawned out of the void with some particular nature. Either way, it can\u2019t logically have determined its own nature because it can\u2019t precede its own existence. This is crucial, because it means that every subsequent decision it makes is a result of its original nature and the state of the environment in which it operates. Its decisions affect itself and its environment, but the chain of decisions would be changed by a different original nature. This shackles the will to the variables of original design and environment, neither of which the soul is responsible for.\n\n\n\n When you try to describe everything with laws, of course you cannot have free will. Free is the opposite of law. Free will is something that by definition cannot be further explained or examined. But is it impossible for something to exist, that we can only broadly understand and never examine? That does not mean that free will violates the laws of physics or is not in harmony with them. It could be just a part of the universe that we only can have access to, by our own expirience of it.\n\nThe universe does operate according to the laws of physics, so it\u2019s sensible to describe the fundamental levels as adhering to those laws. It\u2019s very sensible to talk in this way which extinguishes all room for free will, because that very manner of speaking is in line with how we know the universe actually works. To claim otherwise and to hope that free will has some hiding place in the gaps of our understanding about the universe, despite all evidence and logic to the contrary, is intellectual suicide. ",

  "i haven't watched the video yet, but it's cool that you had a Quora answer and a video all setup to help explain your stance. This is obviously something you've given a lot of thought. I have too, largely because it's core to some of the introspective practices I've done to better understand myself.\n\nI agree that it's essentially a semantic issue. There are exceptions--people who hold some metaphysical view where they believe in some aspect of their consciousness that's separate from time and space, yet still can observe, choose, or whatever. Maybe there's something to all that, but it's not my experience, and from the sounds of it, not yours either.\n\nLanguage inevitably evolves, but, at the same time, it's only really useful when we can share a common understanding. I would lean towards semantic conservatism first, but I'm not convinced this view of \"choice\" is what most people mean when they use the word. My personal view is that it's fine to use the same word, but it's *also* important to call out choice as an illusion. For me, it's personally important just so that I can continue to approach a more accurate view of my own life.\n\nAlso, I would say most people who don't do philosophy for fun or play around in subs like this probably haven't even really considered it to this level; they take choice for granted. I guess this goes back to your main point in the Quora article, but it just seems like people are so often talking past each other re free will. We think we're having a discussion, but we're all arguing completely different topics.\n\nAnyway--good conversation. I'll watch your video when I get a chance. i've never considered the Christian position as 'god micromanaging'.\n\nI've always - and afaik those that I've discussed this have always - understood that god was to have set the rules (the 'laws' of nature), set things in motion, and then intervenes when he wanted to (by way of miracles).\n\nI don't see what the whole 'chaos' or 'noise' adds to the proposition.\n\nThis basically creates two \"worlds\": A \"cloistered world\" of the song file and deterministic mutations over time, and an \"outside world\" of you as the programmer, able to intervene and violate the cloister's rules as you please\n\nI don't see it that way at all.  It sounds more like you've simply created two levels of control.  The level of control that manages our day to day lives (physics) and a level of control that manages physics.  You have no evidence whatsoever for this additional level other than it fits your model.\n\nIn your example the song file could be a metaphor for the universe.  The deterministic mutations a metaphor for the natural changes that occur over time either by direction (conscious) or entropic.  \n\nThe 'rules of direction to, say, preserve the melody' you add to the mix are just a fanciful way of describing miracles.  God would still be violating the rules by 'stopping the mutation' or 'manually editing it'.  He'd just be doing it by changing the rules of the rules instead of just the rules.\n\nIf there's no god then the 'cloistered' world as you call it is all there is.  If there IS a god and he wants to intervene then regardless of how he does so he's going to necessarily violate the otherwise inviolate rules of determinism in order to do so.  So what does all this discussion of 'chaos' add?  \n\n",
  "Sure it does, because we are dealing with something measurable.  I can't measure morality, its abstract.  nothing you are doing even halfway resembles any experiment, you are just playing word games.",
  "i like the way you think.   \n\n\nI don't agree with determinism and mentioned predictability because of the examples I gave. If all moral choices are determined by previously existing causes then every person that is beat should grow up to behave in kind. Perhaps that's too fine a point on the definition, but you can see why I would think humans would be too unpredictable to fall into this definition. If people who were abused always ended up behaving that way I would believe in determinism. Admittedly, I don't understand the concept very well as it seems like common sense (ie, of course we are somewhat a product of our environment).\n\n\n\nFree will is the ability to process all that has happened to us... and all our previously existing causes.... and make a choice of our own accord. Free of what I had referred to as fate (an exact layout of our futures that is unchangeable) or creator design (God programmed me to always behave, or messed up so I don't). Free of deterministic factors like an abusive parent or being born in a war zone.  \n\n\nI may not have the correct definition, but it works for me. i now see that we are talking about different types of free will. you are leaning more towards the compatibilist side, which defines free will as \nbeing able to act according to ones motives. in that sense, we are free when we are not externally coerced into doing things we do not want to.\n\nhowever, determinism posits that your motives themselves are already determined according to your brain state, which is nothing but the current configuration of your brain matter, which in turn ultimately behaves according to laws of physics.\n\nnow, terms like having abusive parents or living in a war zone etc. are very high level and therefore coarse definitions (there are abusive parents and then there are abusive parents), so they cannot be considered deterministic.

  "This isn't the case, though. Many scientific results require experimental setups beyond the ability of children.\n\nIt depends what results you're talking about.

Since you're doing light armor, those -flesh spells will be handy, since they will boost your armor.  While the -flesh spells are the heart of Alteration, it also has several specific but very useful spells.  For instance, Candlelight is basically just a magical torch, and magelight is a magical torch you can stick to walls.  Transmute ore allows you to change iron into silver into gold.  Detect Life and Detect Dead do just that; allow you to see living or undead enemies through walls.  Waterbreathing gives you an extended swim time, which, while never really outright necessary, can make a few optional sections of some dungeons a lot easier.  Paralysis just allows you to drop an enemy for like ten seconds, and Mass Paralysis does several.\nAll of that is the argument for getting the main perks (novice alteration/apprentice alteration/etc.)  There is a perk that boosts the amount of time alteration spells last, as well as a perk which, when all three skill points are in it, boosts natural magic resistance to 30% permanently.  Finally, the Atronach perk gives you 30% spell absorption.  What this means is that, 30% of the magic spells that hit you will do nothing to you and give you all of their magicka.

That quest isn't a challenge in the first place. At first it appears as \"go look at this pretty statue sometime\" it's not forced on you. And if you're going that route, there are other quests, like the second half of the wold queen, where it's likely to be impossible for you to go by this logic if you also go by the same logic here of \"seek out hard quests at a low level\" On top of that, you can complete the Azura's Star quest without ever getting hit by the fire.\n\n#4 You're the one not thinking of other playstyles. You keep bringing these things up as if they matter. If you *want* to use race buffs, then use them. I really couldn't care less. But telling a person new to the game that there's a \"recommended\" way to be X class, which ends up sounding like \"it's a big deal, it'll be hard if you don't do this\" when that's not even remotely the case, is a different story.\n\nYou think you 'stated the facts clearly' but that's not what you did. You also act like you took into account how other people might play, but that's not what you did at all either. You act like because you care about one tiny, irrelevant part of the game that isn't necessary at all for anyone who'd rather play as X race for rp, or because they like the appearance better, or because of XYZ reason, it's the end-all be-all determining factor of how successful your playthrough will be with a given class.",

I recommend going after those passive abilities I mentioned before, Windshear, and Spellbreaker between sessions of power leveling.\n\nPlaying the game this way and nearly making an invincible toon has made playing the game enjoyable. I can focus on the story without worrying about dying. \n\nI would use the Alteration glitch later. E.g. After you level the main trees you want to use for your toon.

  "oh please, let's not even talk about the fit and finish while praising the pocophone. The pocophone is the definition of cheapness with a high end SoC inside. \n\nLet's talk about what you lose with the pocophone:\n1. Fit and finish: say what you will, the OP6 oozes high-end when you look at it. The pocophone has a plastic build, the screen is super rounded with very high radius that doesn't even match the phone corner radius(on OP6 it does), the chin is very big, notch is unnecessarily large(no notifications on status bar :( ) and the front just looks weird and cheap. Even the Redmi line looks better.\n\n2. Software: miui has ads, you have to beg for bootloader unlock, android updates are non-existent. Let's not even argue that miui is crap. I'm currently running a fully stable beta of pie on my OP6 on the other hand and will have a stable build by the end of year. Heck, even the 2.5 year old OnePlus 3 will receive pie before the pocophone. This is also the reason that the only phones I consider are OnePlus, pixel and Nokia (7 plus is awesome)\n\n3. Small things like water resistance, widevine L1 support, community support, and the fact that I can buy a OnePlus now, while I have to wait for a flash sale and wait for the pocophone to get available for a few seconds.\n\n4. Camera: not even close. No OIS is a joke\n\n5. The pricing of the pocophone is something called as penetration pricing. They are bleeding money to get market share, just like OnePlus did with the one. They will have to increase pricing as they go on. \n\nI'm not denying that the pocophone is an excellent phone for $300. But it's not OnePlus 6 competitor. The mi8 is. And the mi8 loses the headphone jack, the big battery and gains $120 over the pocophone for that OP6 level finish and camera.\n\nThere is no free lunch. Note 9 is a better hardware than the OP6 because Samsung spent a lot more than OnePlus did both on RnD and manufacturing cost. As a result, it costs more. Just get what you can afford and suits your needs. If you are fine with the pocophone's sacrifices, go for it. \n\nI personally found the OP6 sacrifices fair enough and was reluctant to pay the extra $500 for the s9+ (with that infamous Exynos 9810). So I got it.  Pretty good for what it is but not as good as the likes of iPhone X/8/8+/7/7+.",

  "Slimmest bezels on usable flagship for years to come, first phone with SD8xx chip (I might be wrong on that), first phone with back lock button (I see you are mentioning HTC One Max below, but that came a bit back later and HTC immediately dropped them while LG hold to them until today which I'd say influenced everyone). It tried best placement of volume buttons ever which sadly didn't stick for longer. I want to be clear in saying the G2 was an amazing phone. I bought one used when the G3 came out, and thoroughly preferred it over the Moto X I got new several months prior. Especially with the G3 ROM, battery life, camera performance and sound quality were all legendary. \n\nBut I'd argue an important phone is also influential-its existence and popularity can be directly tied to design decisions on later phones. This is reflected in the original article. \n\nI've already discussed why the G2's slim bezels probably weren't influential. Side bezels have always been getting slimmer, and the G2's launch neither accelerated this trend nor caused further advertisement related to bezels. The G2 did not cause other phones to use Snapdragon 800-series chips, as several competitors launched with the CPU within months. No phones currently use back volume buttons, and only LG has a rear power button-so the design clearly did not catch on. (Rear-mounted FP scanners were in the works prior to the G2, and popularized far after by Google, as I also flesh out later). \n\nThe best justification I can make for the G2 having a lasting impact is that its double-tap to wake feature is related to the single-tap required by the iPhone X. But that's a small feature, and that phone launched 4 years later-so I don't think there's a significant connection between the two. ",
  "for me its only been once and she was super determined because she considered it a challenge, it just took forever.

  "an emergency fund isn't a car savings account, that's something completely different. Although I consider my car savings part of my safety net (along with my health savings account and my car repair fund), they aren't part of my EFund. Saving for short term goals is definitely a viable use of income once your desired efund is achieved though. \n\nEnjoy the model 3, they look awesome and are a blast to drive true. But it's an account that can be used to use when you have built enough reserve. And in reality it can be used if it's needed. Such as a new roof or totalled vehicle. For me I have enough accounts that I just keep adding money into my emergency account to build up enough to spend what I want without fear of depleting the emergency fund. That is why I will contribute and have contributed to the account for the plans of purchasing a new vehicle. I also like to contribute to the fund and when I reach several thousand over the desired goal I will roll it over into a longer term solution.\n\nThe biggest thing is 1 size doesn't fit all and for me more is better then less. But my risk aversion is less then others and more then others. I am 47 and still have many years to continue to earn. I have a comfortable retirement and am on track to besting what my goal is. But that could change tomorrow and I don't want to have to dig into it. In my field of. Employment it is getting tighter without further schooling and if I do that it would eat into my savings pretty quickly if I only had 6 months saved. Even 1 year would be something that could be eaten away if I went several months without employment and decided to go back to school. That is why I will Co to he to grow the emergency fund as long as I max all of my retirement investments and maximize my tax break vehicles. But as I age. I have to look at more less risk investments which means. Ore into savings with a slower growth but still getting something back even if it's a little less then inflation\n",

Figure out what you need to be comfortable.  For example, Bioral's dental chairs are old, but they use the latest dental implant technology and top of the line implants.  I'm getting work done that would have cost me $40-50k in the US for $14k.

That weight will go up in poundage terms as and when it does. If you can't lift more weight, do more reps. If you can't do more reps, add a moderate intensity additional set at the end, if you're having a high gravity day accept it and train for a sick pump, etc. Consistency is key. \n\nYou seem to be at your wit's end.

  "knew you\u2019d come along.  And not just the camera, but the lenses and filters too!",
  "\"Buy all the lenses\", yep, sorted ;) \n\nI agree though, my specific issue is around shooting music festivals and this year I found I needed a lot of different focal ranges all at once (except so much when shooting the bands themselves).  you photograph your friend who is next to you, and on the other side of the street is a tree. From your point of view, when you look at the two dimensional image in the viewfinder, your friend appears about as large as the tree. If you stay on this side of the street but ask your friend to go to the other side next to the tree, now he looks much smaller than the tree. The take away, perspective in a nutshell, is that things that are closer to the camera look bigger than things that are further away.\n\nA fun way to grasp that notion is to look at *forced perspective* images such as this. Obviously the kid is not a giant as large as the tower, but since she's much closer she appears larger in relation to the object farther away.\n\nThis phenomenon has nothing to do with lenses. But you'll note that to *keep the same framing around your friend* when he's next to you, vs when he's on the other side of the street, you'll need to use a different lens. That's the *field-of-view*, which you can more or less think of as an optical \"crop tool\"\u2014you could shoot your friend who is on the other side of the street with a wide angle and crop severely in post, but of course you'd throw away a lot of image data and end up with a poor quality image.\n\nThat's about it. If you keep the same framing around your subject, but use a wide angle, you'll reveal more of the environment behind the subject, which is one way you can contextualize your subject. If you use a longer lens (again, keeping the same framing around your subject), then you'll show less of the background and further *isolate* your subject from the background. The choice of depth-of-field will further allow you to contextualize or isolate.\n\n(Not sure if that's what you were asking or if it's all redundant to you...)",
  "Thank you!! :-) t \nH\nA\nN\nK\n\nY\nO\nU\n!",
  " What i've read is that the depth of field is shallower on a full frame then a crop sensor at the same focal length and aperture.\n\nActually it's the opposite\u2014emphasis on \"same focal length\".\n\nBut normally you *wouldn't* use the same focal length\u2014in order to maintain the same framing and perspective you'd use a *longer lens* on full frame, and *that's* what ends up making the depth-of-field shallower on full frame.\n\nBut yeah okay. Unless you want the very most *razor thin* depth-of-field you can possibly get, at such short distances, you can get quite shallow depth-of-field on APS-C as well. I meant equivalent focal length. Same goes for medium and large format",

  "you're far more likely to damage a shutter blade than the coverglass on your sensor realistically. It's easy to clean a sensor, most do it on their own. Fixing a shutter blade that was gently nudged? Better call the manufacture and get your wallet ready.  i'm not sure it's fair to say Sony dropped the ball.

You should protect it, but you just got unlucky with where the rain got. If a Sony fails in that exact same situation, of course it did, duh. In other words, I wonder if the respective reputations of the companies let us dismiss failures of Canon but canonize (lol) failures of Sony.\n\nOur brains are really good at the latter.

Americans are being left in dirt by a loud-mouthed braggart, racist and xenophobe who has a history of rape, sexual assault and \"inspecting\" the locker rooms of teenage girls. Prior to his presidency, he called for the racist murder of innocent men, repeatedly chose profit over patriotism, scammed contractors and drove multiple businesses into the ground. As president, he lies daily, thinks leadership is yelling at people, has failed to accomplish anything of worth and is completely out of his depth. He's the most hated president in history.

Irix makes superior lenses, period.

I thought they would announce a single model that would sell for the same price as other manufacturer's entry level models but have the features of a high end model. But apparently they are basically copy-pasting Sony's model scheme. If their pricing will be similar I'm inclined to say you're right, and that the camera will not sell.\n\nDepth-from-defocus as opposed to phase-detect focusing is a significant drawback. I will all come down to the pricing. Undercut the competition and it just might work. Be in the same ball-park and I don't see this working out.",

The 85 f/1.8 is an excellent example of good, cheap, compact 135 format film lenses that make full frame a great budget option. \n\nm43 isn't bad. It's great if you want a compact system. The cameras are smaller, and the slow primes are smaller than nearly anything available on full frame, at least if you want autofocus. The size advantage of m43 becomes even better if you want weather sealing. But if you want fast lenses for shallow depth of field and/or low light, m43 is just a lot more expensive and not much smaller anymore.\n\n",

  "You are completely two-faced on this issue. You are ok with the government punishing people if they are \"trolls\", but not ok with the government stepping into a situation where obvious censorship of rational thoughts is taking place? There are congressional candidates running for office that are getting timeouts and bans. That's... election meddling. In a nutshell you're more worried about trolls than open discourse happening about the candidates who will be making decisions for America.\n\n\"So are you saying I can say anything I want to say and just telling people I shouldn't be taken seriously makes it all okay? Not how the world works regardless of political ideology.\"\n\nIt IS how it works in a free society. Are you not American? If not I understand why you wouldn't think this way. --However--There are consequences for saying terrible things and then trying to cover it by claiming it was fake-- you do that one time and people are going to STOP taking you seriously, as they should, but censoring them  opens the door to censoring everyone.\n\nI stand by my other point. He got fired for trying to be funny, and you idiots lost your shit over nothing and pushed for him to be fired. Because you have no sense of humor about ANYTHING. You are now trying to differentiate between \"ok sign\" and \"bad right wing troll sign\" when they are the same thing. Kinda like you do with genders. You look at a boy and think he could be 58 different \"genders\", everyone else who isn't mentally challenged looks at him and says, that's a boy.\n\nAll in all, postmodernism has melted your brain to the point that you can't see things for what they are.\n\nI'll take a right-wing troll over a super serious leftist frothing at the mouth any day. You people just suck all the fun out of life entirely, and make everything so complicated even Jesus himself couldn't follow all the rules. Odds are high that the guy was just trying to be funny and get a rise out of people, but now he can't serve his country because you people went insane over someone apparently showing \"solidarity with trolls\", aka doing funny stuff that normal people would laugh at/with.\n\nLast point. Honestly? We need trolls right now in American politics. PC culture has almost destroyed real engagement in difficult discourse. People need to be free to say what they actually think--Trump won and no one thought he would, why is that? Because 1/2 the country didn't want to tell anyone who they were really voting for, because they knew they'd be shunned. you are completely two-faced on this issue.\n\nActually, I would support classifying Facebook as something akin to a common carrier, or perhaps creating a legal cause of action for people when Facebook et al crosses certain lines. I also don't want PC culture to have too much say in these rules, because that might result in a certain loss of fairness like the culture the PC culture was born to fight back against created against them. So you are badly misjudging my position. And I don't hold this position out of any sympathy for your \"troll\" politics. What comes around goes around, and conservatives are facing the backlash from they themselves dished out. Conservatives created the PC culture by creating a no rights environment for those that didn't tow their social ideological line. And now the conservatives are in danger of the same thing happening to them. It came around, it went around. Now conservatives are demanding government protection of their rights from private entities, just like women and blacks did and got labeled a \"protected class.\"\n\nHence, I want fairness even if it's not for me specifically, and you benefit instead. And it's not because I give a rats ass about your politics, or your whining about those SJWs violating your rights. It's just ironic, but you confused my ironic humor at your plight for being subjected to the same shit that created the SJWS to mean I don't support fairness in Facebooks censorship policies that benefits your political ideology. \n\nYou are ok with the government punishing people if they are \"trolls\", but not ok with the government stepping into a situation where obvious censorship of rational thoughts is taking place?\n\nWait, are you saying Facebook is government? It's not, and their censorship has nothing to do with government.\n\nIt IS how it works in a free society.\n\nNo, not unless Facebook is a government organization. In a totally free society Facebook, being a non-governmental entity, is free to censor all they want in their own venue. Just like freedom of the press doesn't mean you have to let reporters in your house. It's only government that can violate your rights, not private people who also have those same rights. The same way you can legally put a sign on your door that says \"No blacks allowed inside.\" Then people can legally say your an ass, and your boss can say we don't need you, go home. And that was what was done with minorities, female, black, whatever, and why those rules of free society got changed and granted them the legal status as a \"protected class.\"\n\nHe got fired for trying to be funny, and you idiots lost your shit over nothing and pushed for him to be fired.\n\nI didn't push for him to be fired. But the fact remains he wasn't just being funny. That's like saying that walking in a black neighborhood yelling the N word is just being funny. Of course he broke no law, because we live in a free country. But to say that because we live in a free country there can't be any consequences for your \"legal\" actions from other free people in the country is absurd.\n\nPC culture has almost destroyed real engagement in difficult discourse.\n\nUnfortunately there is a whole lot of truth to that. But the PC culture is no more asinine than the culture that insisted that denying blacks a seat on the front of the bus, or putting gay people in jail for sodomy, or engaging in voter suppression, or demanding they have the right to decide what people can do with their bodies even if it kills them, etc., etc. \n\nHowever, you claim PC culture shuts down real engagement in discourse. What do you think the trolls that think what the Coast Guard guy is doing was just funny is doing? Their not engaging in discourse, they are merely trolling for the LOLS. And shutting down engagement in discourse is just the biggest LOL there is for them. And that's exactly why media companies are using the thinnest excuses to shut them down. Not because they are right wing per se. And I have news for you. No matter what government protection you think you can get from Facebook censorship it's not going to save the trolls from getting banned.\n\nLast point. Honestly? We need trolls right now in American politics. PC culture has almost destroyed real engagement in difficult discourse.\n\nSo what you are saying is that you need a losing strategy because \"PC culture.\" I've been watching politics since watergate. The backlash effect from this is going to bite back so freaking hard you will not have an ass to shit from. Trolls are empowering PC culture like you can't even begin to imagine. Hur dur dur, look at those silly libtards freaking out over the \"okay\" symbol just like we baited them into doing! No. What just happened was it just got turned into a weapon against you, and a tool to radicalize more SJWs. Because major players don't really give a shit that it was a troll. If they can bend it to further their own agenda then what trolls? Those are just racist neo-nazi assholes. Just like trolls don't care as long as it furthers their agenda. And you think you won. But you'll know how mistaken you were soon enough. You're just unleashing and radicalizing SJWs like never before.\n\n",

  "eh, science is a lot about collecting and expanding on data sets you already have (particularly in monitoring). Data may be pre-logged into the device from previous research, but who knows if someone else might expand on that data.\n\nAlso, my original comment was a snide joke more than anything. Not a lot of things in the Pok\u00e9mon universe make sense. A digital log shouldn't be able to make new entries on its own. The dex only records measurable data that happens on capture. At the start the dex was brand new tech, and before that all you had was observations from people, maybe pictures. Those observations are logged in the dex which is very important when you want to match a pk to a spot in your known database, but at the same time those observed info isn't scientific and pretty useless. In the games you can't whip out your dex and let it scan to give an entry, but that does happen in the show.   \nThe point of the dex is connecting and verifying observed data to scientific data obtained from capture.  \n  \nPre dex entries are basically bird spotting++. That's a flying thing that lives in trees and eats wormy looking things. It has colours here and there and attacks when provoked.  \nWould it be useful to state in the dex that it's suspected to be a flying type, possibly. But capture will also say so and you're not that stupid at 10 years of age right?   \n\nThis here is a swimming thing, it looks like this and it eats other swimming things. It's probably a watery type and it occasionally shoots bubbles at sandcastles. It probably doesn't like humans on the beach. \n Another useless entry but it's what observation level science offers.

  "All fair points.\n\nI will concede that I was talking about more competitive play there, but I still think that having both Espeon and Sylveon in a playthrough isn't a bad idea, just because of Espeon's speed and damage.\n\nAlso, Espeon is one of my favorite Pokemon, so I'm a little partial. Espeon still isn't a bad choice at all :) The problem is simply that an Eeveelution playthrough is already so limiting since they're all mono-types who don't have the widest movepools, so you have some tough choices to make as to who to use.

(but i think i might be in a minority there) to be fair, Luigi's Balloon World was never intended to be a local wireless feature, so that's not really a good example. But I get your point. Each person's opinion on not having save backups depends on what they value. I value the social aspect of the games and if my friend is in the same room as me, I would hate it if we couldn't trade or battle just because the internet went out.

  "Honestly, he two styles don\u2019t feel much different to me outside of four aspects: the Battle Frontier, the Safari Zone, the Suicune arc, and walking Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nHonestly, after replaying Silver on VC, then running SoulSilver, the main portions aren\u2019t *that* different. HGSS added the walking Pok\u00e9mon, which to a degree dodn\u2019t really add much to the actual gameplay. It was cool, but it didn\u2019t change a whole lot. The Battle Frontier was added, but that only matters if you actually cared about that style of battling (which there is a large portion that doesn\u2019t for various reasons). The Safari Zone was a nice addition, as it helped unavailable Pok\u00e9mon become more available, and if I recall correctly the Suicune but was pulled from Crystal. There are things that HGSS also failed to fix, mainly the Pok\u00e9mon distribution (some Johto Pok\u00e9mon found only after getting to Kanto) and the ridiculous and painful leveling experience (especially when you can\u2019t get exp share until after Lake of Rage).\n\nORAS, while not like Emerald, felt more like the original RS. You still have Aqua and Magma doing the same weird stuff, just like TR between GS and HGSS. Still have Aqua investigating a volcano, and still have Groudon under the sea. It, however, added the Delta Episode, a cute little endgame that allowed Deoxys to be acquired outside an event, made Sky Pillar and Desert tower less of a pain to traverse...or just got rid of them. The Battle Resort was introduced instead of the full Frontier, but let\u2019s be real, it\u2019s essentially the Battle Tower format which seems to be the most popular of the Frontiers. And it also began the pish toward HMs not being requored with the Eon Flute. \n\nTo me, ORAS felt almost exactly like how I recall RS being. I know they aren\u2019t perfect, and sorry for the little speech there, but when I see people praise HGSS when the worst points weren\u2019t addressed in it and then look down on ORAS for not being more like Emerald tends to bother me.

  "i struggled to explain what I'm thinking correctly, but I'm basically trying to say that the choice to abandon weak Pokemon should remain a viable option with definite advantages over not doing so, at least within the competitive battling sphere.\n\nThings like egg moves, shininess, IVs, Natures etc, that you can't get on every pokemon without going specifically for them make up part of this decision. (At least until you meet the realities of game design, which is where hyper training, move tutors and the suggested 'nature changer' come in)\n\nAnd that I think having some aspects of this decision exist are intangible but interesting thematically.\n\nI feel like they'll get there with respect to Hyper Training as a more natural mechanic. I felt like that with Pokemon-Amie, and I also felt like Refresh was a much better system despite functioning in exactly the same way. They've been making incremental improvements to systems as the gens go on, not just in terms of systems themselves, but also thematically as well. It's just a little bit slow. (...provided they include them in future games) My main problem with IVs is that it takes way too long for results to get a proper competitive team for even locals. Legendaries may be guaranteed 3IVs now but trying your luck at getting a nice IV spread with synchronise success can take up a whole day and if you need more than 1 of those then its excessively rough on those that have other commitments and can't dedicate 30 hours a week into making comp ready teams. I had a scenario last year where I had two locals and had to shift my team in between. This meant that I had to catch a whole fresh batch of pokemon with proper sets and spreads. If it was simply nature and EVs, it would have taken all but 3 hours. With IVs added in, it can take 10x that and in comp, every bit of HP or attack can make a huge difference whether something lives or dies. Natures and EVs still give a prepared trainer the edge too. A regularly trained pokemon isnt going to perform as well as a specialised pokemon. Some people just simply don't have to time to breed and tweak everything before the next comp especially if the meta shifts.",

That's a massive leap, and one that is not at all supported by their results. \n\nTheir results even showed that they can't prove a link between loot boxes and gambling, just that people that already have gambling problems will spend more on them. That's not a reason to legislated against loot boxes.  Interesting - the full study linked in the to comments with the full 7000 people study has the exact same abstract as the one I linked, just with different numbers.

  "i actually made that map by using Minecraft's ravine generator on simulated chunk data (I used the code for 1.6.4, which operates on a simple byte array so it was very easy to convert it to an independent class), then I read the data for each \"chunk\" (initialized to stone (1) between y=0-62, air (0) above) to find the highest blocks below y=62 with air above and assigned them colors using a similar scheme as Unmined. Green areas represent ravines that reach sea level or higher (y=63) and if you zoom in you can see where they intersect one another; for example, near the left center you can see 5 intersecting ravines, which also happens to be one of several such complexes that I've found in-game, as I created this map using the seed for my first world (\"-123775873255737467\" in 1.6.4; the quintuple ravines are centered at -768, -420):\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/sVGxdzy.png (left is from the actual world, right is a zoomed-in view of the ravines on my simulated map; you can tell that they intersect because of the breaks in the shading in the floors)\n\nAlso, to put the amount of caving that I've done in perspective, I've fully explored about 88,000 chunks underground (this was made by deleting all chunks without torches from a copy), meaning that I've found around 1,760 ravines, so even if they do not intersect that often I've still found a lot, with 5 confirmed cases of 5 ravines (this is not a lot but 4 intersecting ravines is more likely than 5, 3 is even more likely, and so on), while the most that I've ever heard of is 8 near spawn in the seed \"Digital\" in 1.6.4 or earlier (note that while their locations changed in 1.7 and again in 1.13 they have otherwise not changed since they were added in Beta 1.8).

  "here's a detailed rundown. This all happens in a single tick:\n\n1) You flick the lever. This starts a depowering chain in the 3 wires. At this time the block the lever is on is still powered by the wire.\n\n2) The farthest wire turns off first. This updates the farthest piston, but it is still BUDed by the middle block, so it doesn't retract.\n\n3) The middle wire turns off, updating the middle piston. But the closest block still BUDs the piston, so it doesn't retract.\n\n4) The wire on the closest block (the one with the lever) finally turns off. Because it is diagonal, it doesn't update anything.\n\nWhen you replace the closest redstone dust by a lever on top, step 4 never happens and so the pistons retract.\n\nRedstone dust will often (but not always) update from farthest to closest like in steps 2-4. Because this is ultimately locational, its considered bad practice to do anything that could be affected by wire update order. This is why you will often see redstoners use slabs on piston diagonals, since slabs are transparent and cannot BUD pistons. Another alternative is to update the pistons with rails/other pistons/noteblocks. that does explain it. Thanks.\n\nI'm not sure if Slabs would help here though, since they would only activate the top piston on QC. It would no longer reach the bottom two pistons, so you'd need to go for an over-under construction or something.\n\nBut at least it can't fail due to Quasi-Entanglement anymore!",

  "My bad, you\u2019re right. That was another poster in this thread. IMO, if you're going to assume that you're going to have access to multiple guns, it would make sense to optimize them for separate purposes. \n\n\\ but IIIA armor\n\nIf you're facing someone with body armor, the solution is to have a team. You have an astronomically low chance of survival even with actual military grade AP ammo versus a group of unknown origins and intent with body armor, because if you don't have a team and observed perimeter, you don't have shit. \n\nEven with a team, you're at a disadvantage because your place is static and they have to be seen before you even know that they're there in the first place. \n\n\\ body armor\n\nThe primary wounding effect against AR500 steel plate is not actually penetrating the plate itself (you won't, except with large caliber AP ammo; this is mainly because AR500 formed into armor plates are often curved, which will tend to bounce/deflect 5.56 steel tips), but fragmentation from the round splattering against the target. \n\nThe \"spall liner\" will only stop perhaps 2 rounds of any rifle round before it tears off from the frags shearing the liner to pieces. Even a IIIA vest with plate inserts will be rapidly shred to pieces by rifle fragments, which happens to be Kevlar's primary weakness (fiber shearing from sharp edges). \n\nIn that case you want more lead with more energy so that it throws faster, larger chunks up into their jaw/neck. You also want a larger round so that it will frag the items on the carrier itself (mags, etc) more easily. \n\nAgainst ceramic, this still has an advantage of putting more force into the composite, which will shatter/crack (as it's intended to) and then be made ineffective, versus intermediate calibers where it may absorb more hits before failure. \n\nThis would point toward using your AR-10 instead for that purpose. \n\n.308 also does much better through intermediate barriers with standard ball, and is vastly superior with AP. \n\n\\ stockpiling\n\nM193 makes a better general purpose round because it yaws more readily (making it more useful against unarmored targets and medium game) and frags as well or better than M855 against plate, which makes it as useful against targets wearing armor that cannot be reasonably penetrated in one or even a series of shots under the circumstances. \n\n\\ PCC \n\nWhile this works for home defense purposes it doesn't scale as well for defense in this situation, because you can't always dictate range or whether or not the target has armor (in this case, soft armor and hard armor can both absorb a decent amount of 9mm even with an 16\" barrel, and a combination of the two would make it ineffective entirely). \n\nThis is exactly why PCCs/SMGs have fallen out of favor compared to intermediate carbines in the first place. \n\nIt also assumes that you're going to have equal access, whereas I'd wager that you'd probably choose one or the other for general carry. You would choose the AR, which would favor a more generally useful round out of it. \n\n\\  You do you, I\u2019ll do me \n\nWhich is fair enough. ",
  "lol you really need to pattern buckshot at 5 yards it doesn\u2019t spread basically at all. shotguns don\u2019t suck; if you can put accurate shots on target any round is going to be effective.\n\nThey just have higher penetration through walls due to individual projectile mass, and lower penetration through meat/armor due to lower velocity. By the numbers, the carbine/pistol in a rifle caliber is going to put more effective stopping shots on target in a shorter period of time than a shotgun.\n\nYou can increase the efficacy of shotguns with a semi-auto platform, or high-brass loads, but there is still a tradeoff in follow up shot speed due to more recoil and less capacity in the magazine.\n\nJust train with whatever gear you use and you\u2019ll be fine",

In response, England told us to fuck off then burned down White House.\n\nThere's even a stanza in there (that you will never hear unless you look for it) that glorifies the massacring of slaves who had been conscripted by the British and offered their freedom in return. I would say that that the subject of the National Anthem should be a point of humiliation given today's general moral standards. \n\nTL;DR The National Anthem glorifies an aggressive war that was wildly unpopular, that we started (and sentiment was built using fabricated intelligence, even! Iraq wasn't the first time!) on home turf, where we drastically outnumbered the foreign defending force but still managed to take nearly twice as many soldiers KIA, and we achieved nothing for it.

It's essentially the same thing as Artifact Knowledge in Legion , but reversed so the values of AP stay the same and we don't end the expansion with numbers like this: \"Grants 102927363829268 Azerite Power\".  so the basic trigger for the requirements I mentioned was wrong.

This is not content we enjoy the umpteenth time we do it... \n\nWQs are and have always been 90% travel time - all of the kill elites quests  with the default system are still just that. \n\n  \nWe, as players, understand that there is a lack of actual content, actual relevant questlines for each faction  to get you to exalted, we accept that.  But please, for the love of Bwonsamdi, let us do this tedious content as we did in Legion.\n\n\n\nWe are still going to spend time in the game doing fun activities, i'll be damned if at times i don't prefer fishing to the mindless grind that is WQs.  (i don't even wanna touch on the laugable 700g rewards for emissary quests).\n\nRant over... for now :)  You don't find a piece of optional content fun but find it fun when you can be auto accepted into group?\n\nGonna call your bullshit, you're not going to unsub. You're just crying while trying to justify it by waving your $15 a month around like it means something. It doesn't.\n\nYou won't win. Blizzard has you by the balls. They can do one of the laundry list of things they said they would do if auto accept was kept in the game. They could also just go in and code out the functionality, send a cease and desist to the makers of the mod, or amend their ToS to make those types of add ons against the rules. You won't quit over something so insignificant, no matter how much you huff and puff about it either - because you know deep down how stupid of a hill that is to die on. \"Oh no, if I want to complete an optional piece of content someone has to hit 'accept' to my application or I need to make my own group, or take one to two minutes to complete the quest by myself.\"\n\nWorld's smallest violin.",

  " Also, random crits aren't necessary, at all, to allow players to take risks and make mistakes. You could: Have teammates, Have even just a medic, Not push literally to their spawn gates, Grab health/ammo packs, or any number of other things\n\nWith random crits being stalemate breakers, there are plenty of other things that are also stalemate breakers\n\nYour teammates who fight suffer the same hp/ammo advantage compared to spawning enemies as you do. One medic can't be everywhere at once. You don't have to 'literally push their spawn' to run into freshly spawned enemies with full hp, especially in CTF and 5CP, since they run at you while you run for the point. Full health packs are rare, not enough to supply an entire team, and going for them takes time from pushing for the point. And despite all of these things being possible, tf2 still has very common long stalemates in symmetrical gamemodes in practice-- which means removing random crits will make those stalemates *worse.*\n\nThat's my bad. I didn't realize it was you that wrote those comments. I have a habit of not really reading usernames. :/\n\nAll G\n\nAs I've written elsewhere in the thread, I don't think random crits are a good source of memorable moments\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/7pcq20/highlyadvancedsniperuberstrat/\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/BeneficialAffectionateCaudata\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/83pq3o/randomcritinstant_regret/\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/8tdc5k/lookatmeimthespynow/\n\nsome examples. These were clipped by the users and reached page 1 on r/tf2 because they were memorable moments created thanks to random crits.\n\nYou can also see a poll here which attests that players find what random crits bring to the game fun.\n\nI concede they can encourage new players, but I think there are better ways of doing that. You could bring new players into the game so they fight other new players rather than pubstompers\n\nBut that hasn't happened yet *and may not happen at all,* so encouraging new players remains a point in crits' favour. As for 'newbie casual', that would mean massively increased queue times for anyone with over 100 hours.\n\nGive them utility (atomizer, ubersaw), allow new playstyles (demoknight, trolldier), add combo potential (axetinguisher), or any number of other things that, again, I'm not creative enough to come up with\n\nLet me point out three facts. 1: Melee weapons in TF2 are an unskilled method of attack with notoriously unreliable hit detection. 2: Casual values fun over skill. 3: Competitive values skill over fun.\n\nRandom crits provide a way of buffing an unskilled, borderline broken means of attack in Casual (where people find it fun and want to use it in meme builds) without buffing it in Competitive (where they would rather it wasn't prominent).\n\nIt's the difference between having 24 demos crammed into a small room spamming pills at each other versus having a completely fair fight then suddenly dying at full health due to something you inherently couldn't predict\n\nOK so for a start the chaos thing refers to *unpredictability;* secondly, there is no random crit that can kill you from full health \"without you being able to predict it\". \n\nRandom crits reward bad aim as much as bad play. No damage falloff, high damage for even a tiny pellet hitting, and the like\n\n\"High damage\"? You get 18 damage. That isn't high. Point is, if your aim is so bad you can't hit the enemy at all, random crits will do nothing at all. If your aim is bad with a scattergun or rocket launcher, crits will do *less.*\n\nWhile it is a balancing tool, I don't think it's a great one. It's been a joke for a long time that \"oh guys no it's not op, this weapon's ok cause it says no random critical hits cue laugh track.\"\n\nThat's not the balancing tool I'm talking about. I mean making things stronger in comp without buffing them in pubs by including random crits as a weakness. Refer to the melee thing earlier.\n\nThey become more effective for: being random and unfair because you're less likely to expect them and prepare for them, adding annoying chaos, and having a negative experience with them be more prominent in your mind when you think of them.\n\nPreparing for them is as simple as avoiding enemy attacks, which you should be doing anyway. \"Annoying\" and \"Negative experience\" is subjective, refer to earlier poll.\n\nAgain, random crits do not add variety. I don't know where the hell you're getting that idea. Random crits do one thing and one thing only: kill someone. That isn't variety\n\nReading comprehension son. The variety they provide is in making weak new player enemies who would not normally be a threat something to actually wake up for (in case they crit), in making melee weapons a relevant weapon, in shaking up the opening order of a fight (eg: the pocketed Heavy who would normally always survive the opening fight might die to a crit), and in incentivizing crazy, last-ditch risky suicide plays in case you get a crit, even if the odds are stacked against you.\n\nDesigning the game around the lowest common denominator is not a good idea\n\nSeems to have been a fucking great idea considering TF2 has lasted for 11 years. Taking new players into account keeps the game alive, and nocrit servers are an option for you if you don't like it.\n\nIt is not a fun \"exception\" for a fight to be cut short by literal rng.\n\nIt isn't \"literal rng\". It's AIMING and DODGING\n\nThe engineer repairing the sentry is also standing behind the sentry\n\nCrit splash.\n\nRandom crits do not make players push\n\nRandom crits allow one player who is making a push because their team won't to continue it, without being at a disadvantage to the freshly spawned enemies, as I stated at the start. I didn't say it *makes* them push. It just helps players who *are* pushing. lol there you go again, 'breaking stalemates'. How the fuck do you use a random mechanic that both teams can get access to to 'break a stalemate'? Both teams can get the crits. So if the defending team crits your medic where is your push going? \n\n\"Breaking stalemates\" hasnt been a good reason to keep crits, ever. For obvious reasons.",

That it could cure paralysis of the legs or insanity have been dropped from the arsenal of propaganda pushing the practice, but other claims are still taken seriously even when the only evidence for them are three deeply flawed pieces of research by people with vested interests in Africa.\n\nThroughout the rest of the developed world, there is a very clear medical consensus: routine infant circumcision cannot be justified on medical grounds.\n\nI refer you to Wikipedia on circumcision:\n\nThe ethics of circumcision are controversial.[2][3][4] During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the primary justification for circumcision was to prevent masturbation and intentionally reduce male sexual pleasure,[3][6][7] which was believed to cause a wide range of medical problems.[2][3][6][7][8] Modern proponents argue that circumcision reduces the risks of a range of infections and diseases as well as conferring sexual benefits.[2][3][9] By contrast, opponents, particularly of infant circumcision, often question its utility and effectiveness in preventing diseases,[2][3] and object to subjecting newborn boys, without their consent, to a procedure they consider to have debatable benefits, significant risks and a potentially negative impact on general health and later sexual enjoyment. \n\nFrom the same Wikipedia article:\n\nDr. John Harvey Kellogg recommended circumcision of boys caught masturbating, writing: \"A remedy for masturbation which is almost always successful in small boys is circumcision, especially when there is any degree of phimosis. The operation should be performed by a surgeon without administering anaesthetic, as the pain attending the operation will have a salutary effect upon the mind, especially if it be connected with the idea of punishment.\" But he was opposed to routine circumcision of infants: \"It is doubtful, however, whether as much harm as good does not result from circumcision, since it has been shown by extensive observation among the Jews that very great contraction of the meatus, or external orifice of the urethra, is exceedingly common among them, being undoubtedly the result of the prolonged irritation and subsequent cicatricial contraction resulting from circumcision in infancy.\"\n\nKellogg was a significant factor in the propagation of this practice in the US and yes, circumcising boys as a punishment for masturbation or doing it at birth to reduce sexual pleasure, which is the real purpose, is pure evil.\n\n\n",

Chock this one up to bad journalism in the original link well the original article was published in the Toronto Sun. It's not so much of an issue of bad journalism, but more likely as you mentioned you're unfamiliar with the case.  Not sure if you live in Canada, but if you do you should have a passing or more familiarity with the case because of how big it was at the time.  \n\nIt was one of the first cases where a publication ban was put into place, and newspapers were seized at points of entry into Ontario, TV \"entertainment\" shows were blanked out, and news broadcasts from the US on cable were blocked in order to stop the public from learning about evidence in the case and possibility contaminating the jury pool.

  "i read a headline a week or so ago:  Male student kicked out of gender studies class for asking how women can be empowered and oppressed at the same time.\n\nIt was pretty amusing, but it was only hosted on a competitor to The Heritage Foundation something, so I can't tell if it's a legit story or not.  Usually I judge a story to be legit if it's published by numerous sources.  This story, just the one site. It is another example of an innate bias being exploited. Women have an innate hypervigilance in guarding their sexuality from men they find undesirable as the cost of getting pregnant through most of our evolutionary history has been incredibly high and they cannot reproduce frequently so finding a high quality mate and avoiding low quality ones is of paramount importance. Men have an innate desire to help women do this as they have evolved to protect their woman, the women of their tribe e.t.c and also have an aversion to other males sexuality as other men are rivals so expressions of male sexuality is a threat. The man strong woman weak narrative certainly feeds into this as well. Feminism has the same attitude to male sexuality as fundamentalist religion.",

If these boys turn 17 or 18 and are resentful that their sisters were given knowledge that they weren't, and all they know is violence, hopefully the familial bonds between them, their mothers, and their sisters is strong enough to overcome that resentment. right, how is this \"feminism\", exactly?

  "I like the changes Chopstix2005 made as well. However, I'd recommend a larger SSD if you can afford it.  R6 alone takes up nearly 100GB and I think it's well worth storing games like that on SSD. If you have a 500GB SSD or greater you'll be able to get a few AAA games on there plus most of your most used applications like discord and MATLAB.  i like this list but I would use a better ssd. Get a nice 256gb UD pro from gigabyte. They're usually cheaper than the samsung evo ssd's and performance is on pair. Maybe get a 512gb one if you can save some money here and there. For ultra 1080p 60fps a 1080 is overkill. A 1070 or 1070ti would be more than enough, even for 144hz 1080p with high settings in most games. ",

  "And what about the storage?\n Storage looks good as well",
  "Well at least for gaming purposes  The card just plugs in. If your PSU can handle it, that's that. The motherboard kind of limits your options with that CPU, ATM, but that's water under the bridge. The motherboard has a negligible effect on performance, as a whole.\n\nThe rest is just having the performance to not be stuck with the card loafing around, waiting on your CPU. With higher resolutions, you can make more use of the card with a given CPU, but higher FPS, to feed high refresh rate monitors, needs a faster CPU. How fast, in either case, depends on the game(s) in question.\n\nFor RAM, while speed can matter in some cases, capacity is king. If you have enough, you're good, and if you don't, things get real slow, real quick. The rest of it you may see people talk about is trying to get that last little bit of performance squeezed out of their system. In practice, any RAM is going to be between tens of thousands of times, to millions of times, faster *than most SSDs*, so fitting necessary data into RAM is kind of important.\n\nSince you can't overclock on that board you have, an 8th gen i5 or i7, or Ryzen 2600X or 2700X, would be reasonable upgrades, with enough RAM added in there. That would run $450-700, most likely, more if you really wanted to do a really nice build. Basically any worthwhile CPU upgrade would mean needing a new CPU, new motherboard, new RAM, and likely a new Windows license.",

  "Intel has been unable to keep up with demand for 14nm chips, so that will certainly hurt things. If they are making 8 core dies, this are going to be big and whitened to manufacture do to poor yields as die size increases. With big dies, it is hard to find dies where everything is up to spec. That means Intel is making big dues with low yields on a prices that can't keep up with demand and the chop you want to buy would have to be a really good bin. They have all the ingredients for a massive shortage on their hands, whether they manage to avoid it is up to them.  they are having more production problems. They rolled their chipset over to 14nm and now can't make enough 14nm silicon. They were expecting to have 10nm working for cpus before chipsets took over the 14nm process. ",

That\u2019s what I thought. \n\nYou\u2019re repeating talking points from Fox News.\n\nI\u2019m talking about indictments and guilty please by many in the Trump administration and campaign. If we want to extend the discussion to scandals? Then the Trump administration absolutely takes the cake. \n\nIt\u2019s telling that all you have is Trump himself. Especially since his lawyer has testified under oath that Trump directed him to pay the two porn stars to change the election. \n\nAnd can we trust Trump? The guy who said he had no knowledge of paying the porn stars even though we now know that he did and was lying the whole time?  First of all, IRS targeting, the Benghazi weapon smuggling, the CIA leak, and Clinton's history are all examples of illegal activity by previous presidents themselves.  If you want to talk about their administration then yeah, you can draw a funny kind of line around certain people and say that Trump has more people in his administration that have plead guilty than any recent president.  But if you expand that line a bit to include all people directly associated with/allied with the president then you again get huge lists for all presidents going back at least to Nixon.  So yeah, I guess if you want to define things in such a particular way then Trump is an anomaly.  It's still telling that with all these guilty pleas and investigations nobody has found proper evidence that Trump himself is guilty of anything.  I believe in judging people by what they do, not what their friends do.\n\nHis lawyer is breaking the law by abandoning client privilege if he's really telling the truth.  And are you seriously saying that two porn stars changed the election?  How the hell do two porn stars affect a national election?  Did they get his face tattooed on their breasts or something?\n\nEvery president going back to Roosevelt has been caught lying to some degree or another.  That's part of politics.  You have to lie to make yourself look as good as possible because the alternative is that you are proven guilty and the media crucifies you.  Look back at the Clinton presidency \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman\".  You can find plenty of examples for both Bush and Obama.\n\nTrump isn't a great president.  I'm not even sure he's a good one.  But my god, get a grip.  He's not the nazi-saluting, white supremacy endorsing, racist, moronic, criminal that the media is making him out to be.  He's a businessman who has entered the world of politics.  Neither businessmen nor politicians are known for their integrity or squeaky clean records.  Trump is not so strange in his level of supposed \"corruption\" even if the worst rumours about him are true.  He's only abnormal in the levels of reporting and media attention everything he does is getting.",

Their contributions were different. But even if Salah is better than Reus (he probably is), that says nothing about his comparison to Neymar. Neymar proved himself at multiple different clubs under multiple different managers over a course of several seasons. The comparison is quite laughable.

Just pulled that outta my arse, btw), and the dragons become unicorns and \"bittersweet\" is that the freakin comet crash lands into the Shadowlands or that ties asoiaf up neatly for readers...\n\nWhile the show ending will probably be Jon kills the NK, Tyrion gets Casterly Rock, Dany has twins, fairy dust flies about Planetos but *aww shucks* Branno has to sail off into the sea with Daenerys/Gandalf because they're just too darned magical to stay in Westeros now that it's all fixed up, so off to ~~valar~~ \"undying lands\" he goes! Life's PEACHY! ...but we'll miss Branno and Daenerys but... ~~LOTR~~ GOT epic music swells, Jon has tear fall from eye as he takes a leak on Cersei's remains.\n \nI've just learned to accept GoT as a completely different entity from the books and in that way, am able to have *some* fun with the show. But I don't really think we can get book spoilers much from GoT anymore. They *didn't nail the first season* even. Diverged LONG AGO! :)  there was plenty of speculation that bran would leave the cave\n\nI recall it being in a magical fashion, though (which in TWOW may yet happen). As DD pounded into our heads through S6/S7, Bran's DEAD. And if Bran died off so fast, I imagine BR died off just as fast after *whatever happened to him happened.*\n\nI think we'll see a mystical connection between the Starks and the Targs (or Valyrians), at least in the \"magical\" realm if not DNA-related. I can imagine the Pact having ripped the \"First Men\" from the \"sheepherders\" causing some catastrophic epic fail...\n\nAnd sadly, I can see this being Bran's coma-dream *thanks to the show.* He wakes up, Sean Bean's opted to stay home, none of that other stuff happened, \"*or did it*\" open ending sort of thing. (There'd be differences in the world; the sigils wouldn't mean as much as they seem to... *or they did* but something Bran does is Weirwood.net fixes the seasons and resets the world. All is well, but because of Bran's Epic Journey ...and maybe his prize is, he can walk. That sorta fits with prior GRRM novels (which are a bit \"out there\" for my liking, tbh, but having a kid \"really fix the world\" so hard that he'd look insane for telling it, but dangit HE'S why the seasons are right?

  "in \"When Morning Comes Mistfall,\" the existence of Cloud Castle depends upon people believing in the lie that is the wraiths. So when the scientists go on the expedition to find out that the wraiths aren't real and discover the cruel truth of the planet, it straight-up makes the world worse. People are at least somewhat better off with the charlatans and the unanswered questions than they are with the truth (which is a reasonable position to have if you are a fantasy writer), because the sense of wonder is a beautiful and important thing.\n\nThis story makes the rather rare and daring claim that scientific discovery as an impulse with no boundaries is more of a threat to an established society than fanciful stories about magical monsters are.\n\nIn \"The Way of Cross and Dragon\" the society of Liars, which goes from world to world creating religions, is not positioned as malevolent. They make the worlds they go to better by giving people something to believe in, and in the end, their argument converts the main character, who goes from belief in intrinsic religion, to skepticism about religion, to belief in instrumental religion - religion for a purpose.\n\nIn \"Bitterblooms,\" which, like all of these, has a lot of deep irony in it, is about a lonely woman who desperately craves wonder, beauty, and human connection, and who finds it in this other woman on this derelict spaceship, who uses the spaceship interior viewscreens and archived recordings to convince the woman she has gone on all sorts of amazing journeys. When the woman discovers she has been lied to, she leaves in anger, but she goes on *actual* amazing journeys through the rest of her life, and still craves the intimacy and wonder of the lies she was told on the spaceship. She goes back to the spaceship to die, begging for the woman to lie to her again.\n\nIn \"Dying of the Light,\" even though the whole warrior culture of the Kavalar is framed as an archaic, farcical perversion of old survival practices, the existential self-realization of the main character depends on him accepting to a degree the precepts of that empty culture, and particularly its attitudes about violence and ritual combat. Because in doing so he is making a meaningful choice on what to become as a person.\n\nAnd that's kind of the angle here - it's an existential argument for framing our lives with \"lies\" - that our existence precedes our experience to the degree that objective truth and the self tend not to exist on the same level - that objective truth is a crappy and inhospitable place to be human - and that along with being a being comes a certain power and freedom to frame the way you believe and live in a way that serves what you need - and also an opportunity to improve the lives around you by considering them as beings with needs rather than as manifestations of truth. Yeah, I think you're right about that. My worry is about who is actually behind this. There definitely seems to be some implication of a conscious/sentient entity directing some of these things. I really don't want it to all be Bran, like some people think, or some number of other characters.\n\nI think I would prefer it to be something \"other\", even if it isn't a proper god or other omniscient being. But that's just me. I guess that's part of my take on the story, though. With confirmed magic, the concept of god, non-god or just god-like gets pretty blurry and possibly meaningless. For example, if it's all Bran or all somebody else merged with the weirwood.net then that is effectively the Old Gods. The religion might not be \"true\", but there's confirmed, observable truth to it that we don't get in the real world, for example, in regards to religion. So it's less like the religion isn't true and more like the followers of it just don't realize it's \"all Bran\" or \"all Bloodraven\" and so on.",

  "i suspect that image could be her vision of the Doom - the blood oozing from the knights also looks like lava.  yeah, the best guesses are either it has to do with FB and a chapter about the doom, or that it's in TWOW, and refers to Euron essentially recreating the doom in Oldtown when he attacks it, and blows the Horn of Joramun.\n\nHowever, something else it could be is Victarion sailing through Valyria. There are many who think he dies at the Battle of Fire, and that might happen, but we know death isn't final, and he's conveniently got a red priest with him. I think Victarion makes it out \"alive\" (or actually alive), and brokers a betrothal with Dany (matching the HotU vision), saying he'll give her his ships if she marries him (somewhat matching the show with Theon/YarAsha giving her the iron fleet), and she says she will when they get to Westeros.\n\nDany has a huge army, and they'll need to be split up when traveling west through Essos. Some will go with Victarion (probably the Unsullied and freed men), others with Dany (Dothraki), and the rest (mainly sellswords) with Tyrion/Brown Ben (and I think Barristan). Victarion will probably have a dragon in his possession (not bound to him, but they'll have it captive in a ship most likely), and he'll be on a high, and want to match Euron's deeds and try to sail through Valyria. So it could refer to Victarion (why we get the Greyjoy sigil), sailing his fleet through the ruins of Valyria on his way back to Westeros.",

  "That's a rather rigid way of looking at it. \"There's probably a much higher chance of a Dornish Ruler being gay or bisexual than a ruler in the rest of Westeros\"\n\nThe population of gay/bisexual people is the same everywhere. But the fact that in Dorne people dont give a damn about sexuality means that people can be openly gay and be sure that noone will repress, insult, marginalize or kill them.\n\nOn the other hand, people on the rest of Westeros tend to be homophobic, which means that its hard for people to be openly gay because someone might repress, insult, marginalize or kill them.\n\nThis is why there is probaly a higher chance for a Dornish Ruler to be *OPENLY* gay. Its safe to be openly gay there,which means people can show attaction to the same sex, experiment, fall in love, do whatever sexually and be sure they are safe.\n\nThere might have been lots of westerosy rulers/ kings that were gay, but because its not safe to be openly gay in Westeros, it was just safer for them to keep that fact hidden. This people can also experiment and do whatever sexually, but in a hidden manner because its not safe to be gay in westeros. \n\nAlso, machismo and homophobia are going to prevent many people with homosexual thoughts from even trying to experiment on those thoughts. Its not safe to be *SEEN* as gay in Westeros either.

  "I explained why I disagreed with the answers you linked to, and why they're incomplete.  If your only response is \"I don't understand enough to keep arguing,\" then that's fine. Top voted answer begins with \n\n You are right and ClicksAndASmell is repeating bad (or misunderstood) popular science over and over again. \n\nOther replies follow the sentiment.\n\nAt that point, you should go and resolve the disagreement with the physicists. All I sought to demonstrate was that you are disagreeing with physicists, and having done that, I consider I've done all humanly possible to demonstrate that your idea of uncertainty principle is wrong. If that's not enough for you, then I have to ask you convince the actual physicists about your point. I'm going to side with their judgment on this one, so unless you succeed at converting them to your viewpoint, I really don't have anything to add here.\n\nEdit: Just to reiterate: I've established that your disagreement is not with me. It's with modern understanding of physics. If you seek to argue with modern physics, I'm not the person to talk to. If you think modern understanding of physics doesn't disagree with you, then it's kind of your responsibility to explain how come the physicists that were kind enough to consult us seemed very convinced that you were wrong. Either way, neither of these options involves me until you've managed to resolve the apparent disagreement with the kind consulting physicists, so you trying to keep arguing with me about uncertainty principle seems just dishonest.\n\nEdit2: One thing I feel like I should add is that apparently non-locality could mean that it's possible that particles actually have speed and position at the same time. It was discussed in the replies given, and it basically means quantum mechanics don't completely rule out the possibility of speed and position being defined simultaneously, but afaik people believe that locality holds, and the best I can tell controversial ideas like non-locality are beyond the scope of this discussion, but I just feel like I should explicitly point that out at some point. And given that now your disagreement has shifted to be the one with physicists rather than me, I figure I have to point it out now or it becomes irrelevant soon.",
  "thanks for the link. It supports my point and directly contradicts what you said: \n\nBased on the morphological appearance of muscle sections from doped and nondoped power lifters, *we conclude that testosterone and anabolic steroids enhances the hypertrophic effects of training without adding new features.* The addition of myonuclei by training and doping appears to be longer lasting in some muscles than in others. The high proportion of split fibers in power lifter is probably due to high mechanical stress. The findings and conclusions in this thesis raise questions regarding relevant suspension times for athletes caught with banned substances in the body.\n\n you left out the part where it says the cells have more nuclei, which is a morphological change. The article discussed two morphological changes, nuclei and split fibers. It states steroid use causes increased nuclei in fibers, but does not cause split fibers.  \nIt doesn't contradict what I said, it supports it  Nuclei are a major component to the appearance of a cell ",

  " The fun should be in finding and potentially fighting players.\n\nThe issue is that without having to work for your kills, they lose their power. As an extreme example, think about the effect a gunfight has on you in something like a Battlefield game (where kills and deaths come in swathes) versus the reaction that a single gunfight can create in DayZ. DayZ is *not* that far ahead in terms of pure ballistics than other games that put a gun in your hand and push you towards other players, yet it seems to elicit a much more powerful response?\n\nI posit it's precisely because you've been forced to babysit your character's health, and thus have a larger investment in the character. For me, this is the heart of what makes DayZ's gunplay fun: But then, I grew tired of most FPS gameplay by 2001...\n\n Constantly scrambling around for food isn't fun.\n\nNeither is sitting in a bush, surviving indefinitely. The goal of the game isn't to interact with other players - though I agree that's the meat - it's to survive. It may be an internal dichotomy to the game design of DayZ... Yes but I had heart pounding firefights in the mod all the time. And I wasnt forced to babysit my hunger and thirt nearly as bad as the standalone. They can keep the loot tables the same but I feel status degradation is insane in the standalone and should get a heavy adjustment. I know a survival game is supposed to be about survival but at what point is the game not fun anymore? At what point does the annoying stuff outweigh the high stakes firefight? In the end this is a game and it's supposed to be fun above all. ",

Im not sure on your definition of ghosting, I know it can mean different things in different games but in DayZ mod it was always referring to logging off when you know a players position, hopping to another server and moving to an advantageous position (say inside the building they are in), and logging back in again. This is not solved by a time penalty because fights in Dayz can be very long, and because players may be trying to hold an area over several hours even.  yes they need to add at least a sound effect to stop people logging in directly behind you at least.

A girl takes a pic with a guy and shes somehow automatically having sex with him based on a pic. \n\nOr a woman who has a sex with more than one guy is labeled a hoe while a guy fucking a new chick every week is getting high fives. \n\nImo porn isnt effecting the s/o the s/o is effecting themselves because of their own personal issues.

I think if both parties are comfortable with porn, it's all cool. There are plenty of women who claim that porn has actually enhanced their sex life and that's awesome.

I guess I just feel like it should be treated like anything else really. - If someone has an issue, it's an issue, and something needs to be worked out. \n\nI think another factor is that sometimes women are insecure of porn because they had an ex who replaced them with porn, used the porn in nasty ways (like comparing their gf's looks to the women in porn), or spending too much time obsessing over porn to the detriment of other things like work, kids, etc so there's that to work through too.

From your link:\n\n The Green Party supports a moratorium on the release of GMOs into the environment and on importation of food and feed containing GMOs, pending comprehensive assessment of the safety of GMOs with regards to the environment, biodiversity and human and animal health.\n\nThere is a strong international scientific consensus on GM safety. \n\nThere are literally thousands of studies on GM safety, all of which find absolutely zero evidence of harm to people, with not one study showing any harm whatsoever. Same with animals.\n\nOn biodiversity, it's well studied and the conclusion is clear that \"Overall, the review finds that currently commercialized GM crops have reduced the impacts of agriculture on biodiversity, through enhanced adoption of conservation tillage practices, reduction of insecticide use and use of more environmentally benign herbicides and increasing yields to alleviate pressure to convert additional land into agricultural use\".\n\nOn the environment, GMO usage has led to a 37% drop in pesticides while giving a 22% increase in yield. So we grow more food using fewer pesticides without converting more land to agriculture.\n\nTheir position is entirely without merit, and is bordering on climate-change-denial or anti-vaxxer level of pseudoscience.\n\nThat they can look at that and think that not enough study has been done is a slap in the face of scientific rigour, and there's no way to believe they will ever accept the scientific consensus.\n\nLet's put it this way: If UKIP said \"we're going to have a moratorium on environmental policies designed to stop climate change until the subject is properly studied\", you and I would both know that if they can look at the sheer volume of evidence for climate change today and not be convinced, then there is no realistic level that they would ever be convinced by and it would be entirely fair to conclude that they were just artificially putting the barrier to an impossible level and the \"moratorium\" becomes permanent, so they don't have to publicly say \"we'll never implement these laws\". Since the evidence is overwhelming on the side of GMOs with literally thousands of studies and a clear international scientific consensus, if the Greens are unwilling to accept that, then there isn't a realistic goal that they would be expected to be convinced by, and so the moratorium is just a euphemism for permanent ban.

Without the square footage, how do I sort houses? A 5br 2000sqft is very different to a 4000sqft. You pick the house size based on the location.

End of the article specifically mentions the airport, which sits on that neutral ground.\n\nThe use of the Gibraltar airport is one of the most complex elements of the negotiation between Madrid and London regarding the future of the Rock. Spain wants to take advantage of the Brexit conjuncture to achieve a joint use of the aerodrome, built in 1938 by the United Kingdom on the isthmus, a part that Spain considers illegally occupied because it exceeds what was signed in the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). Then, the Kingdom of Spain yielded to the British the city, the port and the fortresses, but not that land on which the airport is based. This dispute is part of the bilateral discussions, but is one of the most irritating to the British authorities, who fear a Spanish attempt to give entry to Spanish security forces in a territory they consider their own.\n\nSpain aspires to come to an agreement with its still European partner to jointly manage the airport. Since the United Kingdom is not part of the Schengen free movement area, Spain would claim to have, at some point on the airfield, police or civil guards to supervise the transits. London refuses in round; this aspect almost derailed the negotiation in May.\n\nLondon and Madrid already agreed on a joint use of this infrastructure in 2006, with the Government of Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero.

  "Women, legally speaking, are not capable of rape as this requires a penis to be inserted but it is an odd argument they are making. They are certainly capable of forcing sex, abuse, coercive sex and can be convicted of equivalent offences with the same maximum sentence. It is a legal technicality and quirk rather than a gender issue as such, for example a man forcing another man to penetrate him wouldn't be a \"rapist\" either.  It is often brought up, but people tend to suggest women can therefore force sex with impunity and get away with it entirely on a legal basis as they have no penis, but this isn't actually the case. \n\nIn theory the law could be broadened so any forced sex is rape no matter what the gender or who has the genitalia doing the penetrating, but it would need to be looked into very carefully indeed. Fringe cases, technicalities and wording matter when it comes to the letter of the law. I have no issues deeming a woman forcing sex a \"rapist\" even if they technically go down for another offence.

Is it more unfair that the best footballer makes more money than a less good footballer, or is it more unfair that they are better at football? \n\n\n  That is not in the interests of the people of the UK.\n\nHavn't you learnt yet? No British government does anything in the interest of the people of the UK. They haven't for years. They do juuust about enough to keep people satisfied. Enough to make people not think about the fact that you work for 85% of your life just to afford to live for the final 15%, and that you're paid a pittance to do it.",
  "the comment I linked was in response to this article. \n\nI was already thinking of going vegan several months earlier because of some discussions I had seen about the ethical, healthful, and environmental impacts of eating meat and dairy. Then there were several articles written about how Brexit is likely to result in a degradation of our food laws to allow imports from countries that currently cannot sell food here. Such as the US for it's chlorinated chicken, or hormone/antibiotic filled cattle. \n\nPerhaps they were just investigatory pieces to see what the public's opinion of such changes would be. Without any explicit intent to make the changes. But the fact that they were using the welfare of animals as a bargaining chip made me realise that I cared, and that if I cared it was bizarre that I would still eat them. So I rejected eating meat along with the notion that animal rights are negotiable. Good for you ",

  "As the \"Wrong Ryan\" scene from *Saving Private Ryan* (with Captain Tightpants himself, Nathan Fillion, as the Wrong Ryan) shows, you need a way to differentiate between all the guys with the same name so you don't tell the wrong soldier all of his brothers have been killed in action when they're like 6. And using a placeholder letter like X or Z wouldn't work because there's a chance you'd end up with a couple of enlistees with middle names that start with the same letter and you have the same issue. Using \"NMI\" takes up a couple of extra spaces, but it does help narrow down the list of applicable individuals. That's essentially what I'm saying - if your goal is to differentiate individuals, you could use the extra four letters to actually communicate some information, like two letters of the first and last names. The middle initial may differentiate between James Ryan and James Francis Ryan, but it does nothing to differentiate between John Fitzgerald Reynolds and Jacob Frank Robert, or even James Frederick Ryan, our aforementioned Wrong Ryan.\n\n(Writing out more of the name also doesn't help with James F. Ryan and James F. Ryan, which is likely why soldiers also get a serial number.)",

The main question is value. \n\nAnd the RBs just below those top 8 (top 25%) aren\u2019t scrubs either. Dalvin Cook was awesome pre injury. I don\u2019t doubt that Jordan Howard, Devonta Freeman, or Mccaffrey could be part of a top offense. \n\nEven this list - which is over 1/3 of the starting running backs - doesn\u2019t include old badasses that might have more in the tank (Shady, AP, Marshawn) or guys that have unrealized potential but could break out. \n\nThere are plenty of good running backs. Yeah, they\u2019re not all playing at the same level. But is the price difference between a mid to upper tier RB like Freeman or Gordon and a top tier RB like Bell or Gurley worth it? \n\nAlso worth pointing out that a lot of the best RBs are on rookie deals. Obviously that\u2019s good value, but also shows how quickly they get burned out.

There is a well defined schema for telling those clients how to read html documents.\n\nrel='cart-page' is meaningless unless you know to look for cart-page and what that means. Also it is a misuse of the attribute. rel has a limited range of acceptable values. Really everything you've  describe so far should be going in data attribute.\n\nIf you are defining what pages exists, and how to know an elements leads to it, then an api that defines a routing table schema for a client to consume is, for most site frameworks, a one off that never needs maintainence. Most frameworks for building website you could easily just define areas of your site as you making them, and generate the routing table on application start it would have the correct urls everytime it started....this is getting a little off topic though.\n\nMy point is...the client in this scenario is required to have some knowledge about what cart-page means. Or is the scenario your describing the reverse where it would crawl all pages, and associate the links after based on the rel attribute? \n\nBasically I'm struggling to see how rel='cart-page' or anything similar tells the client anything about the page it is visiting unless it has prior knowledge, and if the idea it to associate that link with the cart page, as the client crawls the site....the normal way to do that would be just let it crawl and on the actual page put that information in a meta tag.",

  "So you allow `if (x=0)` and we're back to the same bugs again.\n\nBasically, if you use `-Werr` you are not using a C compiler. It's a different language. You can enable `-Werr` on a single file with old code, but that's no different than compiling that file with a normal C compiler, and then compiling your own code with a C' compiler (where C' is the \"new\" language which does not allow dangerous things you don't like).\n\nIf your advice is to \"by default\" always compile with a non-standards conforming compiler, you might as well just call a spade a spade and say that you are using a new language. When needed for compatibility you could then just relax the language rules as needed.\n\nUsing `-Werr`  your code can break at any time. You never know. Because there is no `-Werr` standard. Why not simply standardize it, and call it a new language (because that is what it is). making a new language is not easy. Python 3 cleaned up a lot of mess from Python 2, but it was a painful transition. Both C and C++ aim to avoid breaking backwards compatibility as much as possible. Plus since it's a committee with many people, you always have some (like IBM) that won't sign on removing trigraphs because they still support platforms without ASCII support.\n\nNot to mention it's very hard to know when code is wrong and when it is intentional. Which is why people use linters that say stuff like \"you're doing this, is it what you actually intended?\". ",

The rationalization is that they must atone for the sins of their ancestors. That's the only way to repent. It isn't too different from growing up in a religious cult.

Every girl, whether she\u2019s got big or small puppies, knows that the average woven button up that \u201cfits\u201d your waist will not fit your bust and vice versa.

You presume ESL is correct in what they are doing, wouldn't that mean Valve is wrong to do the opposite? Don't you think Valve has data when they decided to have SA qualifiers, and give us a guaranteed spot? Or when they decided to give us more spots we weren't even asking for? How come you get to make presumptions that only serve your opinions?\n\nYou also ask for a cost analysis of an SA qualifier... Do you realize ESL is a gaming network and they organize tournaments all the time? That's most of what they do, you can go to their page right now and see that. What costs are you even talking about? Unless they close their offices in Brazil, they literally have people there doing exactly the same thing they need to do to run a four team qualifier, which is next to nothing, btw.\n\nYou are so passionately defending ESL's right to potentially make a bit more money, emphases on a bit, versus giving the opportunity to an entire continent to take part in their competition. The fact that you can't see how preposterous that is is depressing.",

  "i think it's only fair that an NA tournie has decent amount of NA teams, especially since the teams have well-liked personalities. We have to remember that Valve has to balance fairness with fan service and profitability; a TI without Arteezy, or EG, etc. is a TI that will disappoint fans (more than a TI with RTZ and EG, comparatively, not overall, it could still be a great TI obviously), and potentially bring in less profits. I can't remember which Chinese tournament, but there was one that invited a crap ton of Chinese teams and I don't think any of them made top 4. I have no problem whatsoever with that decision, though, even if they all flop, because they were still potential contenders and they were a crowd-pleaser and good for business.\n\n\n\nBut yes, obviously there is always a \"what-if;\" what if SEA had 4 invites, maybe SEA would've done a lot better; what if China had even more invites, what if EU had more invites.

  "Thanks for your answer.\n\nI've played a few ranked role games and mostly non-role ranked games.\n\nMy experience rarely was different and mostly positive (I think most mid-or-feed players decided to play ranked roles, that's why I didn't meet any in non-role ranked). In both of these modes I've had situations where I wanted to play 4 and other guy wanted to play 4, too, and we rolled.\n\nI certainly account for some mode where mid-or-feed players can play, I just want this mode as far away from me as possible (so idea making the ranked roles an only option sucks from my perspective).\n\n------------------\n\nThe social argument is not about present issues (most of the questions are whether something is \"legal\" or \"good\" from out point of view, I'm not going to pretend these are actually big and serious issues currently).\n\nIt is about teaching new players the wrong attitude (the attitude that the meta is set and innovation is impossible).\n\nThe roles, historically, were CREATED by dota community (and then reformed multiple times: 4 and 5 were split relatively recently, mid was redefined from ganker to midgame carry etc) like builds and other things. It is important for newer players to understand this legacy so they can be creative themselves.\n\nLike, I had this argument with some guy when ranked roles were introduced, and discussion was in line of\n\n\"4 is roamer, 5 is safelane babysitter, it is set in stone\"\n\nNow this argument seems really fun, because guess what - 4 is one support, 5 is the other support once again.

The only time that it would make a difference is if  people in draft will pick a carry and then flex that hero on to Support which I've never seen happen in my life unless I'm playing with a party. Yes bro, if you are at high MMR you don't need it at all ,cause I assume people in your bracket don't fight too much over the roles. But if you are in our 3k bracket you will know how shitty normal ranked is. And also for me queue times heavily improved after 2 weeks . I was even getting mid lane in 5 min . I don't even care  if the queue time goes high upto 10-12 min when I know that I wont have people arguing in my game  from the start of the draft. I think even  if it gets implemented  as seperate entities it won't be a problem to you guys because everyone in higher brackets know that the feature is  useless to you guys and you may end up with high mmr disparity in a game  due to less people in the bracket ,so u wont use it anyways,  and people like us will use it .

  "i have China friends and some of them are working in the logistics sector in China, they've seen the video before and told me that there's always rough handling but how bad it is depends on the company culture and the mood of the workers on site (some people just don't care).\n\nI've also ordered mechanical keyboards from china through a local 3rd party logistics (3PL) company (ezbuy/65daigou) as well and it arrived with the box dented with keycaps fallen off. It's impossible for this shit to happen without throwing and tossing my parcel around, the keyboard was dead within 3 months and I had to fuck the ezbuy/65daigou customer service to get a 20% partial refund (cos they were supposed to inspect parcel for physical dmg when the china company hands them over to their China warehouse). I should have just refused the parcel from the start when I saw the physical condition.\n\nSince then I've tried a couple of other 3PLs/direct shipping from taobao and had better luck. My current blue mx china mechanical keyboard (about USD$20-30 inclusive of shipping) is 1.5 years old and still working well. The other mechanical keyboards I helped my friends to get shipped together with mine should presumably be working well too, since I haven't heard of any complaints from them (yet).\n\nFor those curious about the quality of china mechanical keyboards, I owned 3 razer mechanical keyboards (expensive), 1 armaggeddon mechanical keyboard (cheap), 1 tecware mechanical keyboard (cheap) and about 5-6 china mechanical keyboards (incredibly cheap). The clicky sound is there (70% of the ones I bought were blues), and the tactile feeling when you press down on them is different from premium mechanical keyboards you may be used to (which leads to some of my \"elitist\" friends calling them fake mechanical keyboards) but yes they're still real mechanical keyboards and you can't really complain about the quality when they cost like 15-20% of premium brands. But whether it's worth getting electronic items from China really depends on your luck with the logistics service provider you choose to use/how fragile they are.

  " I was thinking of this in the context of choose build, then, choose items, but more on that later in this post. \n\nA build emerges from choosing a skill and doing everything you can in order to make that skill deal as much damage as possible. If you already chose a build, then you're not creating your own build, but merely copying what's already been created.  \n\n But you would agree that there is quite a significant gap in power between LoN builds and 6piece set builds?! Because loosing out on damage multiplier of 15 to 50 is quite significant...\n\nNo. Sets power do not come through their various +x% dmg increase but from their high synergy with skill. Sets have high synergy with skills because when you create a build you purposely choose the set that has the best synergy with the skill. Not the other way around.   \nThat is to say : you play condemn, akkhan is appropriate because it reduces the resource cost of condemn by 50%, which is the huge issue you'd have if it wasn't for that buff. If it wasn't for the 2p, LoN condemn would be almost as strong as akkhan condemn (slightly worse, because you can't keep AC up 100% with LoN). It's not the 6p \u00d716 multiplier that makes the build. Same for any build really. It's not Firebird \u00d740 multiplier that makes Arcane meteor so powerful. Remove \u00d740, you lose what 20 levels ? It's still a gr100-110 worth build. *just by itself* (including leg. items still).  \nRegarding condemn BTW : why did you choose to play condemn in the first place ? Well, because the sword and the shield looked quite fun. If you remove those (especially the shield), there's no longer a point in trying to make condemn as a DPS skill happen, because waiting for 10s between each cast is... well... not very engaging to say the least. \n\n My main problem is not necessary sets by themself, it is not even legendaries, more specific, my problem is the massively inflated multipliers they provide. \n\nAgain, if you think removing item and set multipliers would make the game more balanced, that's not true. Look at 2 skills in a vacuum : Sweep Attack and Shield Bash. Both have ~500 %WD. Both attack in front of you. Both are intended to be damage dealing skills, with a somewhat AoE oriented goal. Both cost wrath. However, SA costs 20 while SB costs 30 ; SA has a 18y (+ 180\u00b0) range , while SB has a 10y (90\u00b0) range. Why would you *ever* choose to play SB over SA, if it wasn't for item multipliers ? Granted, SB is one of the worse skill in the game even with its supporting multipliers, but still.\n\n The reason why LoN does not bring more build diversity is because of the uneven balance of power on legendaries (which by the way is a result from balancing the whole game \u2013 including legendaries - around 6piece sets and most legendaries therefore just being complementary items for 6 piece sets).\n[...]\nSo you can imagine that the discrepancy between the various LoN builds is quite large. \n\nLoN Bomb crusader does not rely on any legendary item multiplier, and yet is the second (maybe third) best LoN build in the game. Actually, its supporting items are so bad (/non-existant) that when I used to play it (back in S5), my friends and I renamed it trash-sader, because only trash items were used for the build. Hexing pants - trash. Homing Pads - trash. St. archew gloves - trash. My friend would drop the worst items you could think of, tell me \"again this [garbage]\" and my immediate reaction was \"maybe it's an upgrade for me\". I finished the season with taskerstheos equipped for a rank 500-ish clear.  \n\nBut I hear what you say, *some* legendary items are intended to work with a set in particular. Monks' Lion's claw for example is an item that's obviously intended for Uliana EP monk. And even then... it's also used in pure SSS monk actually (yes, that exists).  \nHow many items are actually used in *exactly one build* ? I can only think of very, very few, and those few are *extremely* specific (ex: Johana's flail for hammerdin).  \n\n And I have to say again that if it wasn't for the massive multipliers on sets and legendaries, build diversity would not be reduced by 95+%.\n\nYou say that but have no proof. Remove set  item multipliers. What happens ? Exactly the same as right now, except the balance that having 1500% multiplier on akkhan vs 4000% on firebird dispears, and condemn is therefor 2.5 times stronger than meteor wiz. Did it bring diversity ? No ? I don't see how at least.  \nRight now, item multipliers are needed in order to maintain a balance. Sure, you could divide all of them by 10 (keeping in mind 4000% vs 1500% is not the same as 400% vs 150%, in one case you're looking at \u00d741 vs \u00d716 (relative diff of 41/16=2.5), in the other, at \u00d75 vs \u00d72.5 (5/2.5=2) ; condemn gained in relative power) and keep the same balance, but you can also multiply everything too weak by 10 and achieve the same balance. And it might be easier. And more fun, because usally creating a new item that multiplies damage by 10 also means creating a new mechanic, and everybody likes new alternative mechanics. \n\n so how about a legendary that let's SSS detonate your EP's and let the EP's also deal additional damage which would basically 'nuke' them\n\nIt's not the same gameplay then. You \"invented\" Inna EP with your new legendary. Didn't bring any diversity, actually that just killed a build without even creating a new one instead.  \n\n\n [...] Any combination of skills that follows this structure should be a perfectly viable build, but in D3 they are not, because items determine the build you play instead of just enhancing your build.\n\nAgain, if *any* such skill combination was competitive, you could just pick blindly whatever and call it a day. The goal of D3 is min-maxing. \"Ok so I'll pick this main skill. Then I'll pick a generator (whatever, it doesn't matter). Then I'll pick 3-4 buffs (whatever, it doesn't matter). Ok, my build is done. How long did it take ? Idk, like 30s.\". Next thing you know : \"D3 is too shallow, please give us more thought-provoking choices to make\". If everything works, any choice is meaningless, because choosing something else would have worked just as well.  \n\nYou complain how firebird locks you into using 3 fire skills.  \nWell, 2 things :  \n- If you can't do it, then don't play firebird (almost as if you choose the set relative to your skill slots and not the skill slots relative to your set)  \n- You can also make the *choice* (build diversity, hm ?) to play only 2 fire skills, and proc the 6p from the 2p on-death meteor.  A build emerges from choosing a skill and doing everything you can in order to make that skill deal as much damage as possible. \n\nI disagree. A build can also come from choosing several skills that you like/prefer.\n\nIf you already chose a build, then you're not creating your own build, but merely copying what's already been created. \n\nYou create your own build by simply following a structure that makes sense and then choosing the skills that you prefer, so you are not copying a build from someone else...\n\nNo. Sets power do not come through their various +x% dmg increase but from their high synergy with skill. Sets have high synergy with skills because when you create a build you purposely choose the set that has the best synergy with the skill. Not the other way around. \n\nAnd still a skill is not a build.\n\nThis here is a build that would (and should) be perfectly viable if items would just enhance builds (with more generic effects instead of the more specific bonuses like Skill X deals 800% increased damage etc) and not determine your build like it currently happens in D3:\n\nElectrocute \n\nDisintegrate \n\nFrost Nova\n\nDiamond Skin\n\nEnergy Armor\n\nSlow Time\n\nDMO? No, it does not buff Disintegrate.\nVyr's? Doesn't use Archon.\nFirebird? Doesn't have 3 fire skills\nTals? Does not have 4 different elements.\n\nIt's not Firebird \u00d740 multiplier that makes Arcane meteor so powerful. Remove \u00d740, you lose what 20 levels ? \n\nYou say that a 4000% gap in power is nothing, but I call it absolutely insane. I mean, wouldn't it be more than enough if a build is 100% more stronger than another build? That would be x2 more powerful, which already is a lot. So why does it have to 40 times or 100 times stronger? That is just insane and absolutely unnecessary.\n\nAgain, if you think removing item and set multipliers would make the game more balanced, that's not true. Look at 2 skills in a vacuum : Sweep Attack and Shield Bash. Both have ~500 %WD. Both attack in front of you. Both are intended to be damage dealing skills, with a somewhat AoE oriented goal. Both cost wrath. However, SA costs 20 while SB costs 30 ; SA has a 18y (+ 180\u00b0) range , while SB has a 10y (90\u00b0) range. Why would you\u00a0ever\u00a0choose to play SB over SA, if it wasn't for item multipliers ? Granted, SB is one of the worse skill in the game even with its supporting multipliers, but still. \n\nRemoving the massively inflated multipliers is one step, the next step would be to balance skills accordingly. \n\nBut you should know that just because currently one skill might be better than another, that this can change by simply adjusting some numbers? It is also significantly easier to balance all skills at their base against each other than trying to balance all skills and items to be evenly powerful while legendaries are balanced around sets.\n\nBesides that, SB also deals additional damage based on your shield in addition to the weapon damage multiplier.\n\nLoN Bomb crusader does not rely on any legendary item multiplier, and yet is the second (maybe third) best LoN build in the game. Actually, its supporting items are so bad (/non-existant) that when I used to play it (back in S5), my friends and I renamed it trash-sader, because only trash items were used for the build. Hexing pants - trash. Homing Pads - trash. St. archew gloves - trash. My friend would drop the worst items you could think of, tell me \"again this [garbage]\" and my immediate reaction was \"maybe it's an upgrade for me\". I finished the season with taskerstheos equipped for a rank 500-ish clear. \n\nI never played this build and therefore I have no idea about the mechanics behind it, but one explanation could probably be that the base version of the skill is just too strong or it is too strong in combination with a certain synergy that involves stuff like a massively inflated amount of CDR (I also consider some of the CDR multipliers to be too massive and inflated, aka 65% CDR to Vengeance on Dawn), so what maybe needs to happen is that the base skill needs a nerf or the build involves other insane multipliers, but I don't know.\n\nYou say that but have no proof. Remove set  item multipliers. What happens ? Exactly the same as right now, except the balance that having 1500% multiplier on akkhan vs 4000% on firebird dispears, and condemn is therefor 2.5 times stronger than meteor wiz. Did it bring diversity ? No ? I don't see how at least. \n\nAs I said above, removing the multipliers is just one step towards more build diversity. Balance at the base level of skills is also required.\n\nAgain, if\u00a0any\u00a0such skill combination was competitive, you could just pick blindly whatever and call it a day.\u00a0 \n\nNo, you could not \"blindly pick whatever you want\", you actually had to take into account that your combination of skills makes sense, but I already explained that....\n\n\n\"Ok so I'll pick this main skill. Then I'll pick a generator (whatever, it doesn't matter). Then I'll pick 3-4 buffs (whatever, it doesn't matter). Ok, my build is done. How long did it take ? Idk, like 30s.\". Next thing you know : \"D3 is too shallow, please give us more thought-provoking choices to make\". If everything works, any choice is meaningless, because choosing something else would have worked just as well. \n\nHaha, lol, a very shallow description of what I actually talk about...\n\nWhat you describe is just the basic setup. What you do after this is to farm your items and that is where the more theorycrafting and more meaningful choices come in. \n\nIf legendaries for example would actually have more generic effects, and there would be several best-in-slot options of items for every build in every slot, then you actually had to make the decision if you pick for example the BiS item that is more offensive, or you pick the BiS item that is more defensive or the BiS item that is more balanced in the middle or the BiS that has a powerful effect or another offensively oriented BiS item that is offensive in a completely different way that the first one... etc. etc. etc. and you had to make that choice for every single slot...\n\n... and that in combination with being able to create your own build is significantly more deep, complex, interesting and meaningful than what you advocate for.",

Blizzard got burned badly in MOBAs by doing this. You need to hit the market with a polished product that is accessible too many and sees continued revenue and development. So it doesn't need to be perfect right out of the box anymore, but get the foundation down right and build on it with the community and also some sort of revenue generator (skins or whatever). Again this will send the community crazy, but at least it's not pay to win. It's a model that works and personally I'm happy to give blizzard a few bucks here or there not just for the cool skins, but because I know it goes back into more development.",
  "26, no.\n\nI like it because it was at its core an aRPG. I felt like my character developed and changed more than D3. I only got 99 one time in all the years I played it. For me it wasn\u2019t about reaching the highest level possible, I just played it because it was fun. I hate greater rifts so I\u2019m a little biased on that one if I\u2019m being honest. blizzard could or could not remaster D2. So far they've only done it once and that was SC1. My questions were because I wanted his opinion on why he thinks it's the only diablo game blizzard should make... and I don't recall seeing anywhere number of players still playing D2. Whilst I'm sure there are some, I'd be shocked if it was attracting many new players.",
  "This is actually what led to the creation of whimsyshire.  The original game when demo'd received reviews of being \"too dark\" by critics.  After some changes (no Adria boobies) as a joke the devs created whimsyshire to show to people as their \"dark remedy\" I would love it if the nephalim from d3 went evil, and that d4 sets 2 goals: restore the world stone too nerf nephelems and split prime evil Diablo into 7 evils again, as he would be too strong without a \"God tier\" nephelem too beat him, (and I love the 7 evils way more than prime evil Diablo)\n\nI would also love to see malthael get reborn \n\nP.s.

  "And that's exactly why you don't want to use that skill in the leveling process, IF you want to get to 70 as fast as possible. You want slow spells with alot of AOE. that was the first example i thought of, literally every single skill in the game works like that, sub \"Ray of Frost\" for whatever you feel like using.\n\nIf you wanna stay within mage, archon disintegrate works exactly the same.\n\nNot that it matters tho, in the time we wrote this he could have got quite some levels already, and probably a new weapon XD",

  "I wouldn\u2019t call UE set tanky by any means. It\u2019s more of a \u201ckill everything before I even see it\u201d build. The best defense is a good offense. UE is fine for general farming. Tanky enough for t13. It's pretty fragile though, and you'll get procced running 80+ a fair bit. It doesn't deal with spike damage well.\n\nShadow is ridiculously tanky. Even pre the last big update, i could run solo 87's without breaking a sweat. Its damage is massively buffed since then, so you should be able to faceroll mid-late 80's and be pretty comfortable into the early 90's.\n\nEven with moderate paragon, UE will feel pretty uncomfortable in the 80's. You'll be taking noticeable damage. Not really a problem if you're used to it, just something to be aware of.",

That's impressive.  I honestly didn't think that was possible and certainly not the norm.",
  "Just another question: how long does it take to reach max level? Thanks! people who know their way around the game will level to max in about 2 hours.\n\nFirst time players will take anywhere between 6-10 hours.\n\nMake sure you start a seasonal character if you buy the full game. It's essentially a fresh start with characters that are locked in a mode that resets ever 2-3 months. They transition to your normal account after the season finishes, but you get some really big bonuses just from playing in the season. You'll get a full, complete set for doing a list of objectives, which is like a 20-30 hour head-start on end-game farming.",
  "That's true. After 4 seasons of hard grinding in D3, I came back for some hours D2 and it makes me feel physically ill.\n\nAnd even thou a D4 is more likely than a d2 remaster, my guess on blizzcon is another big step for Diablo 3.  d3 is the one that will age badly in the future without mod support, LAN and offline play on PC. there won't be much the fans can do about it, at least D2 has been kept alive through mods, private servers like slashdiablo, Path of Diablo etc, that do better QoL updates/fixes than Blizzard will care to do. \n\ni play D3 together with D2, it's just a matter of mindset and i have accepted old games will be old. D3 is a fun game in short bursts every season, but i often go back to D2. i think Diablo 3's engine has also run its course and due for an update if there is to be D4, if it's going to be another class like Druid for D3 i am sadly going to pass, just like the necro.",
  "there's 13 legendary bows, four of them are crafted. That leaves nine bows. Nine things you can get while upgrading. If you're doing whirlwind barb there's 20 legendary one handed swords, and only two crafted. But here's the kicker, you need two outside of those 18 left, and you need both of them to get the proper power spike.\nYou can do the same calculation with rings, where there's a huge pool and you need specific ones. Yes rings are important for dhs, but not buildbreaking like for some necro or wd specs.\nDH is relatively easy to gear, that's a fact and that's why people keep saying it.  got Yang's recurve first T, upgrading a yellow 2 hand bow.

  "No problem, I actually love to talk about the game and exchange the ideas but because Blizzard forums are full of people that think all their games are 10/10 perfect. Most of them don't care to talk about new ideas or don't like the games changing and it can be very discouraging to post anything but sarcastic remarks.\n\nPersonally I always liked this rush towards bosses in D2, it made it a little bit less monotone + it would also make the big AoE spells more useful. If we had only Boss arenas I'm afraid there would only be single target builds.\n\nRemoving paragon/caldesann from this mode would be necessary, this way the only character progression would be through quality of items you find, not through infinite powercreep. It would be easier to compete with other people. IMHO it would be better if Paragon and Legendary Gem leveling would go through some major changes. Their implementation feels like a band-aid on a bullet wound and makes implementing new ideas into the game more difficult.\n\nWe already have something similar to the mode i proposed - challenge rifts, but I don't like them at all, they are too restrictive. They force you to use specific class and mostly random builds/items. There's no feeling of accomplishing anything because it's basically a simulation.\n\nI also appreciate the work on D3 but the game can still be improved, as of right now I consider it 6,5/10 It's still fun to play but I believe that with 1 more expansion pack that also reworks paragons, some itemization aspects and other minor things, gives us at least 1 more competitive mode it could easily be a 8,5/10 game. A proper send-off for the franchise and great foundation for the eventually released Diablo 4.\n\nAbout Mephisto - the easiest change would be to either give him some sort of a teleport, change the arena a bit or improve pathfinding so he won't get stuck like a dummy on the other side.\n\nI loved pre nerf/rework Azmodan, as of right now he just talks nonsense and spawns a mob. Maybe this fight is actually better if you allow it to drag out. I don't know I never cared to test it. He dies too quickly. eDIT: I had network problem and submited the same response twice...",

Could be wrong though, that was years ago. is it only frozen orb or with any cold skill regardless of class? \n\nIn short, is the skill bugged, or the gloves? \n\nIf its the skill, did you try with/without gloves to check damage?

  "sasuke has always been more creative in creating new techniques, he always comes with new abilities like: Manipulating Amaterasu to make a shield, the ability to swap places using Rinnegan,\n\nHe didn't create any of these, both of these are special MS and Rinnegan abilities, only belonging exclusively to him.\n\nmake a merger of Susano'o with Kurama's avatar.\n\nThese isn't a technique, even Madara did this. Even Naruto did plenty of stuff that can be labelled as technique creation if this is considered as one, for i.e he created chakra arms, something even Kyubi itself cannot accomplish. \n\nI'm not saying that Sasuke isn't creative, he is, but so is Naruto. \n\nAlso, in this novel, he based this \"Lorentz Gun\" off the Scientific Ninja Weaponry's new research, the Hokage - the one who these Scientific Ninja guys work directly under - should also be able to do this, so questioning wether the the leader of this whole village can use this or not shouldn't even be a question in the first place. \n\nNaruto relies more on the skills he already has and enhances them, such as the Big Ball Rasengan and Rasenshuriken that are absolutely OP. So they're just following the script as it always was.\n\nHe used Earth style in one of the other chapters, aswell as the Shadow Shuriken Technique in the anime, the databook also stated that he has *many* more techniques, so that's not true anymore. I would agree with you if it was Part 1 or Shippuden, but Hokage Naruto has shown enough variety for me to disagree with this. \n\nNaruto can also use ice, as Six-Path Sage Mode gives you access to ALL elements, including Ice, Lava, Boil, Magnetism, and Ying-Yang.\n\nHe cannot use Ice, he uses all the other elemental bloodlines because of the 9 Bijus chakra, each element used in that Rasenshuriken barrage corresponds to a specific Biju inside him, Ice doesn't belong to any of the Biju.\n\nI understand your concerns, but understand that the focus of the story is now Boruto who is training specifically with Sasuke in a SASUKE'S NOVEL, so because of this we are seeing more of Sasuke's abilities. \n\nExcept we saw Sasuke use Ice style in a part of the story which had nothing to do with Boruto, and that part was obviously done in a way to glorify him - Konohamaru's reaction in that scene only further proves my point. The thing is, if they wanted to show any character's abilities, they'll simply mold the story in a way which suits that, the training part is actually irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.\n\nAnyways, let's just agree to disagree.

However, the offspring of two distinctly different parents can yield traits more heavily from one  parent than the other; Genes are dominant and recessive. Look at himawari and boruto; if youre 100% true then they shouldve had a lot of traits similar. Naruto favors his dad heavily physically: height eyes, hair - thus the namikaze traits are more dominant in naruto. This is why someone can be 80% one family and 20% another. \n\nEdit: I just realized you mean representing genes in the simple manner like family history.

  "from here and when Obito gave the piece of 1 and 8 tails with half Kurama to Naruto, he gave Kakashi six path chakra.  This scenario was different than when Obito was left with nothing when he lost all the bijuu chakra last time.\n\nThere's like nobody mimicking her feats since she has the biggest chakra reserves.  All that's known is that somehow Asura has those orbs for no reason. \"From here and when Obito gave the piece of 1 and 8 tails with half Kurama to Naruto...\" \n\nI'm afraid we are both interpreting this scene differently. I am seeing Obito reaching into Madara in these panels, with no indication he's pulling Chakra from him at that current moment. \n\nI'd also like to note Chakra pulled from another has been depicted as tug-of-wars, from Orochimaru vs Sarutobi, Naruto vs Nagato, Naruto vs Kurama, Naruto vs Obito and Naruto vs Madara. This is especially in the case the for Tailed Beast Chakra. Though,  you may argue some instances are special as they could be described as a soul instead of Chakra. Nevertheless, Obito is not pulling or showing any physical exertion. \n\nI'm still inclined to believe he only pulled Chakra after he tore from the aggregate, taking portions of Chakra from Shukaku, Gyuki, and Madara as a whole.\n\n\n\n  \"There's like nobody mimicking her feats since she has the biggest chakra  reserves.  All that's known is that somehow Asura has those orbs for no  reason.\"\n\nThat is my point. Kaguya is the originator, has the purest blood. Hagoromo's Rinnegan is a dilution of her Rinne Sharingan. The Hyuuga's and Hamura's Byuakugan is a dilution of her own. The Kaguya Clan's own Dead Bone Pulse may be a severely diluted variant of her All-Killing Ash Bones.\n\nI can't use anything from her because she is on the next level and shows abilities no one else does. If she had a Rasengan, that would also likely be categorized as a Kekkei Morra.  ",

Their console is just a more powerful ps3, nothing new that a pc can\u2019t do better, and their stance on crossplay is just so arrogant and outdated it hurts. eh tbh PS3 era graphics are fine with me. PS4 is noticeably better but not as much, which is understandable, transition from 1080p to 4k isn't nearly as huge a difference as 480 to 1080. PC is better if you build it right, sure, but parts are getting expensive due to bitcoin miners. So I will probably get a PS4.

  "if you ask the Koreans I think they were differ.  As I said in a previous paragraph I think Blizzard did the right thing. I think what we're experiencing now is the right solution. \n\nWhy..\n\n1. SC2 is more popular worldwide then in Korea. Blizzard is looking at where the game does the best and that is definitely not in South Korea. By allowing foreigners to do well and earn money it not only motivates other foreigners to play but it also allows the game to grow in regions where it already had a foundation. \n\n2. SC2 doesn't need a strong Korean presence. For a few years now the SC2 scene in Korea has shrunk and I would argue grown weaker. At the same time though there seems to be a resurgence in interest in SC2 and that is shown in the excitement of fans and the growing number of viewers. Have strong Koreans is awesome but SC2 doesn't need to mimic everything Broodwar did. Why can't SC2 pave its own road even if that road is more foreigner friendly?\n\n3. We still do have top Koreans. The number of professional SC2 players and teams may have dwindled but they're still there and they're still really friken good. Instead of making South Korea THEE REGION for SC2 why not make it just one of the many regions that play the game. As foreigners have taken Korean tournaments I'm starting to see Korea (and I think some other fans as well) as part of the community instead of this colossal giant that needs to be defeated. The playing field is more equal and that's a good thing. Again, we don't need to be like SC1 in which Koreans still dominate to this day.  ",

Outside of Vikings (which would hit the carriers directly via focus) all the other Terran antiair options would be better than BC's so it's not like they'd be in the situation very often where you'd want them to be hitting interceptors. Even worst case where that's all you really had you'd yamato the Carriers. I see. I guess that makes sense, but then we're back to the original BC, somewhat, with them having to be stopped to attack air units, instead of them being able attack them while flying away or towards them, and the intent is to make BCs able to attack while moving in both modes.

  "when the person you originally replied to said they think Infested Terrans should benefit from upgrades, what they meant was that they think Infested Terrans should increase in power when you research Ranged Attack and Carapace upgrades at an evolution chamber, just like other units like Hydras and Roaches do. In almost every situation involving Starcraft when you see someone say something like \"benefit from upgrades\" or \"they're behind in upgrades\" or generally even just \"upgrades\" without naming a specific one, what they're talking about are the attack and armor upgrades. This is what the person you replied to meant. When you commented agreeing with them, you implied that you also thought that Infested Terrans should benefit from attack and armor upgrades.\n\nIn my comment I pointed out that Infested Terrans already benefit from upgrades. After you research Ranged Attack at your evolution chamber they will do more damage than they did before. Some units have individual upgrades to increase thing like their speed or range or to unlock new abilities, but the upgrades to increase their damage output and their armor level are done with one central upgrade that affects all of your units across the board. There was a period of time where this wasn't the case with Infested Terrans, even if you had researched attack and armor upgrades the Infested Terrans stats would still remain the same as their base level. This was because at one point Infestors were too strong and one of the ways Blizzard nerfed them was taking this away. However as part of the big 4.0 patch that Blizzard did last November Infested Terrans were restored to gaining benefits from attack and armor upgrades. So it has already been that way for almost a year, which clearly the person you originally replied to didn't realize.\n\nEdit\\* Lol at the downvote.

No shit people can do whatever they want in the comfort of their own room, but to say that the porn industry is not manipulative and that it doesn't take advantage of people who are vulnerable is plain ignorance. By your logic the power imbalance of, adult to child, teacher to student, prison guard to prisoner (which can I also say, are the settings for many modern porn depictions) can be completely forgotten if the undermined body is to be consenting. Although almost all women in porn are freely consenting to depict themselves in whichever way they are depicted, the issue remains that the audience is completely unaware of the reality of what is going on behind the scenes. \nIt's usually not a question of if the actor knows what's best for them. Maybe they do maybe they don't. The fact is it is the producers who make the decisions for them. Not very feminist if you ask me. ",

But I do disagree with what they say. Sure I looked at a couple articles on the site and they do list sources, the claims they make aren\u2019t as \u201cnumber-oriented\u201d as I would put it. Instead of saying in the image that 56% of divorces have a partner with a pornographic obsession, in an article that I found all it said was that it was \u201cresearch shows that pornography consumption is linked to... and greater likelihood of divorce.\u201d No where does it bring up a statistic. Sure they might\u2019ve included a source that supports the point represented on the article. \n\nYou might be asking \u201cso what?\u201d. Basically it means that the wild claims they made on the poster didn\u2019t have the research to support it(at least I can\u2019t find it, let me know if you do), but the claims that they HAVE to site as a scholarly article must represent a more common and less severe claim. The fact that they didn\u2019t even put a \u201cgo to soandso.org for more information/sources\u201d shows that they don\u2019t really want to be wholly responsible to cite sources. \n\n\u201cBut maybe some of us may use this image to motivate us and stop watching pornography...\u201d\n\nBro, look at my comment, I said twice that I agree with their point but not the numbers and claims. I literally could not care less if you use this for motivation, but from my standpoint I don\u2019t want people to spread wrong information. Go ahead and use this as motivation, that\u2019s your choice to believe it. But from a logical perspective it doesn\u2019t add up.\n\nPS - You continue to be annoyed by uneducated people that don\u2019t have facts or data.

That left us with an absolute fuck ton of folks moving to adjacent industries to get entry level jobs because they needed a job.

In the mid 1800s a few more sects sprung up which were non-trinitarian and are considered to be cults by mainstream Christianity. They are seventh say Adventists, the LDS church, and the Jehovah's witnesses. Most modern forms of Christianity view the god of the old and new testaments to be the same god but that wasn't always the case.",

Your ramping up your power. A bounce land is not card advantage or ramp because it doesn\u2019t draw you a card you just exchange reasources. Rampant growth draws a land from your deck and puts it into play. This is a tempo advantage at a loss of hard card count. A bounce land does not increase your tempo nor does it draw an extra resource that you didn\u2019t have before playing it. It is neither ramp nor advantage, your filtering reasources between zones.

I was recently thinking that if I could make an upgrade to LE, having a more solid 1 mana cycler over Carabid would be a starting point.\n\nI will be recording a few games of this build on my YT channel \"MTG Tavern\" over the next few days just to get a feel for it.   Out of interest have Carabids being cut a very recent thing for yourself or have you always just gone without them? I was recently thinking that if I could make an upgrade to LE, having a more solid 1 mana cycler over Carabid would be a starting point.\n\nAs soon as Cerodon and Horror were spoiled, Carabid immediately found itself on the chopping block, they were integral before but I considered the drawback to be too much of a liability for the stats in the new crowd of cyclers, so they were the first to go.\n\nI then shuffled between the two remaining \"old school\" one mana cyclers in architects of will and deadshot minotaur. My preference for a more controlling style of living end had me on architects at first (it was DS meta and bolts weren't really played) but I eventually started shifting towards deadshot minotaur but not a full set. I had actually top 8'ed the last set of regionals on a minotaur list here: https://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/1133811#paper\n\nThat list served as a precursor to the one i'm on now as that was I believe the first time I thought of playing both archfiend and shriekmaw together, the anger was also there was a tech slot against humans, still somewhat of a newcomer on the block at the time. So that shell remained fairly intacted going into this weekend.\n\nI finally decided to ditch the minotaur altogether a bit after, it's indeed somewhat greedy but sometimes you have to take big risks to win big and the inclusion of the fourth SSG and the third archfiend tied it fairly well given the meta spread as of late. Though if you're still in the market for a one mana cycler, i'd recommend minotaurs. On paper, it does present a \"nombo\" with some of your own creatures such as faerie and archfiend but I found it was easy to avoid, especially if you prioritized cycling it last or even saved it as trigger fodder for archfiend or horror.\n\nGood luck and have fun with your testing :)",

  "i think I'll just explain the problem:\n\nIt isn't \"we will beat inflation\" that's the problem claim. \n\nIt is \"we are risk free\" that's the problem claim.\n\nAll other banks offer loans and partake in investments which carry risk. TNB won't. This means that they can only invest in the riskless asset of US Treasury bonds and hold money with the Fed.\n\nThe model is required to beat inflation specifically because if, even without fees, the bank holds your money without any investments greater than inflation all the money declines in value meaning that giving your money back to you essentially becomes an impossibility. If you put in $100 after inflationary adjustment they can only give you $1.95 back at that rate but the cost to hold was really $2 so you make -$.05. That's without fees.\n\nHowever even with the fee without any means to produce a profit greater than inflation, because the fee is part of an already underwater system, the cost to operate goes beyond culpability and then we end up with a naturally insolvent system.\n\nSo \"stupid\" people like me are why you're not scammed all the time because \"smart\" people like you don't know what too focus on. Now level 2.\n\nFDIC. The money in an openly insolvent bank is insured by Fed. So the Fed gets shafted for raising its own rates by a run on this bank because it is naturally insolvent to begin with.

I use a moisturizer (Origins Plantscription) and a primer (Murad Invisiblur), letting each dry completely before putting on the next. I put a few dots of foundation (Est\u00e9e Lauder Double Wear) on my nose, cheeks, and forehead, then blend out with light strokes (It brush). A brush doesn\u2019t soak up any foundation like a sponge does, so maybe start with less and add more as needed?

He\u2019s a top centre in the league. This all started because I ranked Gasol better than him overall due to his skill level, but also versatility. I\u2019d much rather have Gasol on my team because his skill set is rarer and harder to find.    This all started because I ranked Gasol better than him overall due to his skill level, but also versatility.\n\nNah I don't have issue with this at all. I just think a role player is someone who supports the core, whereas a player like Capela is actually a part of the core that gets built around.\n\nIn terms of identity, the Rockets without Ariza are still going to play a very similar way this coming season compared to how they played last season. Losing Ariza hurts them, but it doesn't change their fundamental identity. \n\nHowever, the Rockets without Capela aren't the Rockets.

  "the actual questions skeptics ask are:\n\nFirst off this is also a gross simplification.  Many if not most people on the other side of this do not take this how much attitude.  \n\nLets skip your questions and start with where this hypothesis comes from.\n\n2- Aerosol molecules (technically solids do too but penetration is not as deep) without symmetry absorb light increasing stretching/vibrations which decays as IR, or within heat's spectrum (stretching is a clue heat is basically internal kinetic energy of molecules)  We could probably identify a value one molecule creates with a photon density similar to the sun but idk this.  (this goes to point 2.  Locally in the smallest sense we could identify exactly its value).  Increase this increase temperature is climate change theory.  This is beyond theory.\n\n\n1- there are explicit examples in models where adjustments are made to exaggerate values. IMO and statistically show to be \"reasonable\" assumptions.  This again is where they match economic models.  The assumptions get forgotten 10 years from then and it fails.  Our instrumentation measurements are good, but they cannot be everywhere or we block the whole sun.  We need a happy medium.\n\n\n3- we can absolutely say increase CO2 = increase temperature in our climate based on reply 1 to question 2.  This assumes were(earth) is a closed system.  That is not accurate, but not entirely false.  Few things in terms of matter escape earth.  Helium is an example.  But heat isn't inherently matter eather (it is kinetic energy of matter which can go back to space as IR).  Another option is that CO2 is turning into vegetation or otherwise removed from the air.  We can measure this and there is a feedback loop it seems but it also isn't as fast as we need it to be.\n\n\nThe thing about 3 is we can predict all the rationalizations and they don't matter much.  Solar cycles etc.  If we look at that example it isn't predicted well in models, but think of it as a sinusoidal curve.  Yep we aren't rising as fast or even falling but the entire curve is shifted up with these values.  When it rises again...bad news.\n\n4-  I personally don't think we need to that is a tort question.\n\n5- again issues for tort, mostly, however it defies us to not want a way out of cheap fossil fuel.  Long term technology wins every time.  But that is a place for markets.\n\n\n\n  Many if not most people on the other side of this do not take this how much attitude.\n\nIndeed. Too many run into the trap of the alarmist rethoric.\n\n Increase this increase temperature is climate change theory. \n\nAgain, nobody disputes the basic physics behind this and how it would work in a controlled lab environment. The dispute is about how much does it affect the global climate which is affected by a ton of other climate agents and another ton of feedback mechanisms, most of them negative ones. \n\nGot to go, maybe later more.",

Have you ever taken a look at restaurant review sites?  The top restaurants in the world face much harsher accusations than spitting in people's food (such as food poisoning).  Yet many people go to these restaurants every day.\n\nReview sites solve this issue by quantity.  City Health departments use quantity, but also toss out many complaints based on the quality of the complaint.  The sexual assault accusations meet neither the qualitative nor quantitative standard.  A person wouldn't avoid eating at a great restaurant based on a bad review, and the city would immediately toss out a low quality complaint.  Similarly, this accusation fails to meet either of these standards and would have never even surfaced had it not been for the actions of unethical journalists not doing their due diligence.\n\n",

Corroborating evidence would lead a judge or jury to believe in the validity of testimonial evidence, but that does not mean that testimony isn't evidence.
